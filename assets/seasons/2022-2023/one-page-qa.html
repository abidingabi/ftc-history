	<h2>Q<span name="number">3</span> Reuse of previous software</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">May we reuse last year’s software, replacing obsolete code with new game specific logic and other improvements?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">It depends on a number of factors given that <RS03> requires that you update at least to the Minimum FTC Software Version (version 8.0). If you’re a Blocks user this can be accomplished by updating the Robot Controller and Driver Station apps (preferably through the REV Hardware Client), and no changes are necessary in your Op Modes (besides game-specific changes, as you pointed out). If you’re an OnBot Java user you must also update your apps but there may be specific changes required in your Op Modes - see the Breaking Changes section in the SDK 8.0 release notes. However if you’re an Android Studio user you must not only update the Driver Station app to at least version 8.0 but you must also merge the SDK 8.0 FtcRobotController repository changes into your Android Studio Project; this is in addition to any changes required in your Op Modes based on SDK 8.0 Breaking Changes.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">11</span> Is the OctoQuad Encoder Sensor legal?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">https://www.tindie.com/products/digitalchickenlabs/octoquad-8-channel-encoder-sensor/

It is a smart, non-user-programmable sensor like the allowed PixyCam

New teams can only get a single REV Hub due to shortages; SPARKminis allow running extra motors, but without encoder feedback this is unfair disadvantage. Adding an OctoQuad allows encoder feedback from all motors.

OctoQuad satisfies RE17 more than the REV Blinkin which contains an Arduino for which REV has public programming documentation.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No. 

The product is a sensor interface board and requires sensors to be plugged into it to enable operation. Each of these sensors would violate RE12 since they do not plug into allowed inputs on a REV  Control or Expansion Hub.

Additionally, since this type of sensor interface is not specifically addressed in any of the other RE rules, it falls into RE17 as additional electronics and is not allowed.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">12</span> In need of Clarification around <GS13c> and <GS14a> as they are seemingly contradictory</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Scoring element definition includes "The Scoring Elements for POWERPLAY are cones and beacons"
With this in mind-
<GS13c> states that "Scoring Elements may only be placed into the Substation during the Driver-Control-Period.
But later on in rule <GS14a> it says that "A Beacon introduced into the Playing Field prior to the start of the End Game is not eligible for scoring"
Can only place it during DC period. But it won't be worth points if placed anytime other than Endgame.
Need clarification</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">It appears that you understand rules GS13 c) and GS14 a).

Rule GS13 c) specifies when the *Human Player* can place *Scoring Elements* into the *Substation*: Only during the *Driver-Controlled Period*. The *Human Player* may not place *Scoring Elements* into the *Substation* during pre-match setup nor during the *Autonomous Period*.

Rule GS14 a) specifies that a subset of *Scoring Elements*, the *Beacon*, placed into the *Playing Field* prior to the start of the *End Game* is not eligible for *Scoring*. The *Alliance* is not assessed *Penalty* points for introducing the *Beacon* into the *Playing Field* during the *Driver-Controlled Period* before the start of the *End Game*. However, there is still a consequence for early entry into the *Playing Field* in that it has no *Score* value even if it *Caps* a *Junction* (i.e., the *Match Score* is determined as though the *Beacon* was not present.). *Teams* that intend to *Score* their *Beacon* in gameplay must wait until a subset of the *Driver-Controlled Period* (the *End Game*) to place their *Beacon* into the *Substation*.</span>

The *Cones* in this scenario satisfy some, but not all of the requirements for being *Secured*. The last sentence in the definition of *Secured* states that a *Cone* is *Secured* only if the large opening of the *Cone* is facing towards the *Playing Field Floor*. Therefore, the *Cones* described in this scenario have zero *Score* value.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Game Manual Part 2 - Appendix C states "The at rest vertical angle of the pole may vary from Match to Match and during gameplay." The washer at the base of the Low/Medium/High Junctions is 3" in diameter. If the top of the Junction pole is within the Junction Area it is within the tolerances. The note in diagram C-5 is intended to make teams aware that the pole tops will move, depending on the amount of flexing that takes place during a match and/or event.

If a Team feels the Playing Field is not set up correctly, Teams should notify a
referee or field technical advisor prior to the start of the Match.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">56</span> Clarification over a V-Shaped Groove</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Questions 26 and 49 seem to prohibit driving into a Junction Pole with a V-shaped groove since there are two points of contact between the robot and Junction.

A) Would a "U" shaped groove that has 1 point of contact against the Junction be allowed?

"Possess/Possessing" mentions how a robot could "move forward, turn, back up, spin in place" and still hold an object in relative place. 

B) Since a V-shaped groove would lose contact with the Junction when backing up, would it not be Possessing?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer A: It depends on the dimensions of the “U” shaped apparatus and how it is used in gameplay. The referee crew watching how the *Robot* interacts with the *Junction* pole during *Match* play will make this determination. It is not possible to provide an absolute ruling in the game Q&A forum.

Note: This is not an invitation to provide a detailed drawing of the *Robot* apparatus for review. The Q&A Game Forum does not rule in specific *Robot* designs.

Answer B: The defined term “*Possess/Possessing*” is not relevant to the “*Robots* Grasping Game Elements” rule G25.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading game rules G28 and GS8 along with the definition of *Block / Blocking* in section 4.3 of the Game Manual Part 2.

*Blocking* is preventing an opposing *Alliance Robot* from accessing an *Area* or *Game Element* for an extended period by obstructing all paths of travel to the object or *Area*. Rule G28 is applied in this scenario if the defensive *Robot* *Blocks* an opposing *Alliance Robot’s* attempt to access the *Junction* and it is not able to for an extended period of time.

Rule GS8 is applied when the defensive *Robot* impedes or obstructs an opposing *Alliance Robot* from *Scoring* a *Cone* or *Beacon* on the *Junction* once the *Scoring Element* is In the *Junction Area*.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Just checking for clarity:  Is the Gravity:HuskyLens sensor legal for use?  It connects to the REV Expansion/Control Hub via I2C.  Like the PixyCam, it is not user-programmable but has modes to train the sensor on different objects and vision patterns.

The sensor is available from DFRobot as well as other vendors.  More details about this sensor can be found at https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1922.html and https://wiki.dfrobot.com/HUSKYLENS_V1.0_SKU_SEN0305_SEN0336#target_3 .

It has 3 braces ribs connect top and base. Is this design legal (not sure if the 2" top is illegal)? Thank you! Ref: GM1:<TE03></span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There has been some confusion as to how a Beacon should be measured.  The Beacon should be placed in a self-supporting position, that means it is not held at an odd angle by another object, such as the Beacon measuring tool. 
If, in any of the possible self-supporting positions, the Beacon meets the size requirements (larger than 3" x 3" x 3" and smaller than 4" x 4" x4") and it is visually distinguishable from a Cone,  then the Beacon is legal. 
This design appears to meet those requirements.  The 2" diameter top by itself does not make this design illegal.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Yes. This is allowed and supported.

This is a common use-case among teams, there is even an OpMode sample designed to help teams use two cameras (you can find it in the Samples under ConceptTensorFlowObjectDetectionSwitchableCameras). The major caveats with using two cameras are:

1. You can only have one camera active as a UVC source at once; the sample code provided shows how to change which camera is currently the “active” camera.
2. Even with a Control Hub, teams using multiple cameras need to use a powered USB hub – the Control Hub only provides a limited amount of current to the USB ports, and more than one USB Camera may draw more current than the Control Hub can provide on its own. A powered USB hub (like the REV UltraUSB Hub) can power two USB cameras easily.
3. If you’re configuring and aligning multiple webcams during Pre-Match setup, be sure not to violate rule G13e (do not delay the start of the match).</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">120</span> Is it legal to hold one and touch another cone?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">When using separate extended intake and outtake mechanisms, is it legal for the intake to touch one cone in the substation in driver-controlled or cone stack in auto, while the outtake is holding/scoring another cone into the junction?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading rule GS6a and the definitions of "*Control*" and "*Possess*" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2.

Rule GS6a states that a *Robot* may *Control* or *Possess* a maximum of one (1) corresponding *Alliance Cone* and one (1) corresponding *Alliance Beacon* at a time. An understanding of the game definitions of the terms "*Control*" and "*Possess*" is necessary to apply rule GS8a to gameplay.

The *Robot's* actions in the scenario are allowed if the *Robot* only *Controls* or *Possesses* one *Cone* at a time. **The referee watching gameplay is the only person that can definitively make this determination.** A *Robot* using the strategy described in the question should make it easy for a referee to determine when a *Cone* is *Possessed* or *Controlled*. Otherwise, rule GS6a consequences will likely apply.

Example 1: If only one surface of the  stationary *Robot* contacts the second *Cone*, it is unlikely that the *Cone* counts as being *Controlled* or *Possessed*, provided that the second *Cone* is not *Trapped* (a form of *Control*).

Example 2: A *Cone* inside a *Robot* mechanism will likely be viewed by a referee as being *Possessed*. 

Example 3: If there is a *Cone* in each of the intake and outtake mechanisms (2 *Cones* total), a referee is likely to count both *Cones* as being *Possessed* and apply rule GS6a consequences.

**Note:** Keep in mind that *Trapping* a *Cone* against the *Playing Field Wall*, a *Game Element*, or *Robot* is a form of *Control*. This is relevant if the second *Cone* in the described scenario is part of a pre-*Match* positioned *Cone* Stack. It is likely that a *Robot* touching/pressing a *Cone* Stack against the *Playing Field Wall* will be viewed as *Trapping*.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Blocking is defined as Blocking all paths of access to:
1) an Area,
2) an Alliance Specific Game Element, or
3) all remaining Alliance Neutral Game Elements.
A) Is this interpretation correct?
The Junctions are defined as both an Element, Alliance Neutral but never an Area.

B) a specific Junction or
C) multiple Junctions.
provided there is an available point-equivalent junction to score on?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer A: The complete definition of the terms *Block/Blocking* is found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2. The "understanding" of the definition described in the question is a subset of the full definition. 

Answers B and C: No. Rule G28 consequences will apply when a *Robot Blocks* an opposing *Alliance Robot* that is attempting to access an *Area* or *Game Element* for an extended period by obstructing all paths of travel to the object or *Area*. 

Rule GS8a or GS8c consequences will be applied when a *Robot* impedes or obstructs an opposing *Alliance Robot* from *Scoring* a *Cone* or *Beacon* on a *Junction* once the *Scoring Element* is *In* the *Junction Area*.

Note: This is the latest of several posts to the gameplay Q&A forum that attempt to find legal defensive strategies that prevent *Scoring* on a *Junction*. After reading the answers to these posts, it should be clear that *Blocking* access and/or impeding/obstructing access to *Scoring* on a *Junction* is not legal (i.e., illegal) gameplay. In other words, *Junction* defensive strategies are not allowed when an opposing *Alliance Robot's* actions clearly indicate that their intent is to *Score* on that *Junction*.</span>

Answer 2: Yes, if the *Cone* color matches the *Robot's Alliance*.

Answer 3: No.

A *Cone* or *Beacon* touching a corresponding *Alliance Robot* at the end of a *Match* period has zero *Score* value.

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">If a red alliance robot sits on the middle line of tiles B3 and B4 (next to high pole), extends a horizontal slide to intake from A3/A4, deposit to high pole W3, the opposing alliance (blue) robot comes to score on the ground junction V3, does the red alliance robot have to wait and let the blue alliance robot score that ground junction? Or can the red alliance robot continue to intake and score as the blue alliance robot is also scoring?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The ultimate decision would be determined by the referee watching gameplay, with the final call made by the Head referee.

In general, to avoid violating a rule in this scenario, the red *Alliance Robot* may not: 1) *Block* all paths of travel to the *Ground Junction* (V3) per rule G28 when it is clear/obvious that the blue *Alliance Robot* is attempting to access the *Ground Junction* to *Score* a *Cone* or *Beacon*; 2) Impede or obstruct the blue *Alliance Robot* from their *Scoring* attempt once the blue *Alliance Robot's* *Cone* or *Beacon* is *In* the *Ground Junction Area* (V3) per rule GS8. 

In this scenario, it is highly likely that the red *Alliance Robot* will need to suspend their *Scoring* activity to allow the blue *Alliance Robot* to *Score* on the *Ground Junction* (V3).

The blue *Alliance Robot* has an equal obligation to complete their *Scoring* attempt and yield access to the appropriate *Junction(s)* and/or *Terminal* in a timely manner per rules G28 and GS8.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In auto, assuming 2 robots from 2 alliances both try to score a cone on the same pole, Robot 1 bends the pole while trying to score (because one point could push the pole away), thus robot 2 can't score it accurately. Are robot 1's actions penalized for interference?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">As long as both *Robots* are attempting to *Score* (i.e., purely offensive action - no defense) rule GS3 consequences for *Interference* should not apply.

Note: *Robot* interactions at the centerline *Junctions* (row X) are not considered *Interference* during the *Autonomous Period* per rule GS3.

Pro Tip: During the *Autonomous Period*, *Scoring* attempts on the *Junction* rows closest to an *Alliance's Substation* (i.e., *Junction* rows V and W for a blue *Alliance Robot* and *Junction* rows Y and Z for a red *Alliance Robot* are highly unlikely to be called for *Interfering* with an opposing *Alliance's Scoring* attempt due to the *Junction's* proximity to the *Robot's* natural half of the *Playing Field*. *Robot* travel into the opposing *Alliance's* half of the *Playing Field* during the *Autonomous Period* has an inherently elevated risk of violating rule GS3.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">144</span> Multiple grabbing mechanisms.</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Our team has two interchangeable grabbing mechanisms. One is a regular claw and the other is a tension grabber that tightens around the cone. To clarify, only one grabber is on at a time and the other is used as a replacement backup if one breaks. My question is if we bring both grabbers to inspection would we be able to replace say the tension system with the claw in between matches? or would the entire robot need to be inspected again?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Both configurations must be inspected.  As long as the basic functionality of the robot has not changed, there is no need to be re-inspected if the grabber is changed. Remember that the limits on motors and servos will apply to the combined motors/servos of both grabbers and the base robot.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">If we use a deaf student as a human player, our alliance team would be at a disadvantage as they would not be able to communicate with a deaf human player effectively. Can an alliance use two human players? The accommodation of allowing us to have two student human players instead of one human player would work the best in terms of reducing communication breakdowns between alliance teams during the match.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Teams are allowed an interpreter at the field if one is needed. The interpreter is not allowed to manipulate scoring elements, control the robot, or to take over the role of any other members of the drive team. The team should work with event organizers as well as the Head Referee for these types of accommodations.

In the scenario described here and via email to 
*FIRST*, the use of a second human player would not be allowed. 

The match schedules are provided to teams prior to matches starting which shows all teams who their alliance partners are throughout the competition. *FIRST* encourages all teams to strategize with their alliance partners prior to the matches beginning. Alliances may also confer in the queuing area to quickly determine the best strategies for scoring element placement prior to the match beginning. 

An alliance should discuss topics such as robot design (to understand best scoring element placement for robot retrieval) and also ensure that the Human Player understands the rules outlined in rule GS13.</span>

Question 2: In our last tournament, we were warned against pre-loading our cone outside the configuration and waiting for init to draw everything in. Is it legal to be outside the starting configuration until init, then inside the configuration afterward?  Thanks!</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer 1: Your understanding is correct.

Answer 2: Yes. 

The *Robot's* Op Mode initialization is allowed to "draw everything [ i.e., *Pre-Loaded Cone*] in." Keep in mind that the *Driver Station* init button must be pressed before the referee crew signals to the *Drive Teams* that *Pre-Match Robot* setup is complete. 

Note: Rule G14 states that before the start of a *Match*, the *Robot* in its starting location must not exceed a volume of 18 inches x 18 inches x 18 inches and that a *Pre-Loaded Scoring Element* may extend *Outside* the 18-inch cube volume constraint. Therefore, there is no requirement for a *Pre-Loaded Cone* to be within the 18-inch cube starting volume constraint. A *Pre-Loaded Cone* is required to be *Possessed* or touched by the *Robot*.</span>

Rule **TE01** in Game Manual Part 1 states "The predominant color of a *Team Scoring Element* must match the Team's assigned *Alliance* for the *Match* (red or blue)."  The word "predominant" is key here so that the teams and the audience can easily associate the *Beacon* with the *Alliance*.  This means the majority of the *Beacon* must be red or blue. As a word of advice, we suggest at least 70% of the *Beacon* be red or blue.  Half of the beacon being neon yellow would not be acceptable.</span>

	<span name="answer">There are two ways a robot can end up disabled in a match; due to robot failure and by request of a referee.

When a referee declares a robot disabled due to a rule violation, they will ask the team to drive the robot to neutral, non-scoring location and put their controllers down.  This should include robot NOT being parked in the substation.

When a robot becomes disabled due to robot failure, normally an FTA gets involved and works with the team to attempt recovery. The status of the affected robot is normally determined by a collaborative assessment with the FTA and the Head Referee both involved.  The head referee has some flexibility in determining when the disabled status began based on the conversations with the FTA.

In short, due to the quick pace of gameplay, it is to your alliance's benefit to have the human player ask about disabled status and seek FTA assistance as soon as you are concerned about the state of an robot that has apparently failed.

We are providing guidance to the referee community to communicate with the human players as efficiently as possible to minimize impact when robots fail in the substations.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">171</span> Re: Q158 Axon Robotics Odometry Bundle Legality</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Per Q158, the GDC determined the Axon Robotics Odometry Bundle illegal. We were wondering if the GDC can clarify exactly on what grounds this decision was made. 

The product is simply a bundle of parts that a team can theoretically use to build anything using the parts contained. With the bundle, we have the ability to use our own custom odometry designs with the parts. Would our own, custom design be deemed illegal as well? 

We cannot find anything in GM1 or GM2 that makes the bundle illegal.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer Part 1 re: Axon Robotics odometry module: We believe !Q19 and !Q158 answers your question.

Rule RM02 in Game Manual Part 1 states in part: "It is the intent of *FIRST* to encourage *Teams* to design their own mechanisms rather than buying pre-designed and pre-manufactured [Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)] solutions to achieve the game challenge.

The Axon odometry module is a COTS solution to the POWERPLAY *Autonomous Period* tasks that benefit from accurate *Robot* movement along the *Playing Field Floor* (e.x., *Navigation, Cone Scoring*, and *Signal Bonus* tasks) and is therefore an illegal COTS mechanism as stated in !Q19. The universal *Robot* construction parts contained in the odometry module kit are allowed (e.x., bearings, screws, nuts, omni wheel) when they are used in a *Team* designed part or general construction part (e.x., extruded aluminum structural element). Custom COTS parts in the Axon odometry module (e.x., side plates) are not legal for *Robot* construction. 

After the Axon odometry module kit was deemed illegal for *Robot* construction in !Q19, the custom parts appear to have been removed from the odometry module kit and the custom parts are now available as "open source" from Axon Robotics. This is an unsuccessful attempt to find a loophole in the *Robot* construction rules. The Axon Robotics **custom odometry module parts** (the original design or derived versions) even when they are manufactured by *Teams* are not allowed for *Robot* construction.

Answer Part 2 re: *Team* designed odometry modules: *Teams* may use their own custom designed and fabricated parts. For example, *Teams* may design and 3D print, mill, hand form, etc. structural parts for an odometry module. On the opposite end of the spectrum of allowed *Robot* construction parts, *Teams* may not incorporate a Commercial Off The Shelf odometry design and/or kit in their *Robot*.</span>

Answers 1 and 2: Concerning the minimum size requirement, a **cubed shaped** *Beacon* must measure exactly 3 inches x 3 inches x 3 inches or larger in all dimensions as it rests unsupported inside a *Beacon* measuring tool.

Answer 3: It depends on its self-supported orientation inside a *Beacon* measuring tool. The example *Beacon* does not pass inspection if it rests flat on its 3.5 inch x 3.5 inch square base, because the 1 inch height is less than the required minimum of 3 inches.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">197</span> What is considered blocking?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Is a robot allowed to remain parked if another robot is approaching & attempting to occupy the same location or would this be considered blocking?  Based on definition in the game manual-"Preventing an opposing Alliance Robot from accessing an Area or Game Element for an extended period by obstructing ALL paths of travel to the object or Area." It seems robots that remain stationary would fall into this criteria of not allowing access to a specific 'Area', if 'Area' includes a specific tile.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There are many questions in the Q&A Form about *Blocking*, we suggest that you search the Q&A Forum for the keyword "Block" and closely read rules G28, GS8, and GS12 in Game Manual Part 2.

The answer to your question depends upon the location of the *Parked Robot* and the actions of the opposing *Alliance Robots*.  Here are a few examples that may help with your understanding of *Blocking*.

1) A Blue *Alliance Robot Parked* in *Tile* locations A1, A3, or A4 is highly unlikely to be viewed by a referee as *Blocking* because the potentially *Blocked Areas* are Blue *Alliance* specific *Areas*.

2) A *Robot Parked* in *Tile* locations C3, C4, D3, or D4 is unlikely to be viewed as *Blocking* because there are open paths of travel to the *Junctions* adjacent to the referenced *Tiles*.

3) A *Robot Parked* on top of a *Ground Junction* that an opposing *Alliance Robot* shows a clear intent to *Score* on should be viewed by the referee crew as *Blocking*. See !Q54, !Q60, and !Q121 for additional information about this example scenario.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">202</span> Does the game end at the start or end of the buzzer?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The game clearly ends at 0:00. However, a referee stated that robots can play while the buzzer is sounding from the scoring software. We made a case that teams should have stopped moving as soon as the buzzer sounded. Do the robots need to stop moving by the start of the scoring software’s buzzing or upon the conclusion of the software’s buzzer? Yes, it says it in the manual, but our referee said he will go by the game answer forum and we would not like this to be disputed.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading the definition of "*End of the Period/Match*" and rule G20 in the Game Manual Part 2.

The short answer is that the referee at your event is correct. The length of the *End of Period* sound from the scoring system is a grace period for *Drive Teams* and their *Robots* to have time to stop playing the game before consequences start for gameplay that occurs after the *End of the Match*. *Robot* actions during the grace period are eligible for *Scoring*.

The *Match* ends when the *Match* timer reaches 0:00 which coincides with the start of the sound that designates the *End of the Period*. Rule G20 describes the consequences for *Robot* actions that occur at the *End of the Period*. A copy/paste of rule G20 from the Game Manual Part 2 is below:

a) *Robots* must *Park* at the end of the *Autonomous* and *Driver-Controlled Periods*. *Robots* that are not *Parked* **at the conclusion of the “game sound”** receive a *Minor Penalty* and the following actions of the *Robot* do not count towards their *Alliance’s Score*. *Drive Teams* should make their best effort to stop gameplay immediately when the *End of the Period* game sound begins. Referees have the option of issuing a *Major Penalty* in place of the *Minor Penalty* if the late stop results in a competitive advantage (other than *Scoring*) for the offending *Alliance*.

b) *Scoring* achievements that were started (unless disallowed by Game-Specific rules) before the *End of the Period* are eligible to be counted as *Scored*.

c) *Robot Scoring* achievements that occur after the announced *End of the Autonomous Period* and before the start of the *Driver-Controlled Period* do not count towards the *Score* for the *Autonomous* or *Driver-Controlled Periods*.</span>

We made a case that the team should have stopped moving as soon as the buzzer started. Do ANY actions score after the buzzer STARTS if a robot is moving?

If a robot isnt parked, all score is nullified?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We believe !Q202 answers your question. Question !Q203 is essentially a duplicate to your earlier post !Q202 to this forum.

The rule G20 requirement is that *Robots* should *Park* at the end of the *Period*. Rule G20 contains a short grace period for *Robots* to stop playing the game before rule G20 rule violation consequences start because the human *Drive Team* controlling a *Robot's* actions need time to react to the end of *Match* signals from the scoring system (*Match* timer equals 0:00 and/or the *End of Period* sound). 

A *Robot* may continue to play the game during the *End of Period* grace period (length of the sound made by the scoring system). *Robot* motion occurring after the conclusion of the *End of Period* sound should be *Penalized* per rule G20. *Scoring* actions by a *Robot* that occur after the conclusion of the *End of Period* sound should not count as *Scored* per rule G20.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">For the *Cone* stacks only, the Game Design Committee rules that movement of one inch or less is inconsequential and therefore, does not violate rule GS6. **The one (1) inch (2.54 cm) distance standard for inconsequential *Cone* stack movement does not apply to any other determinations of consequential or inconsequential gameplay.**

A referee located in their normal location outside the *Playing Field Wall* will use their judgement to make a real time estimate of the amount of *Cone* stack movement. The Referee should not enter the *Playing Field* nor attempt to measure the *Cone* stack movement.

The "*Cone* stacks" referenced in this ruling are identified in Game Manual Part 2 Figure 4.2-1. 

Note: The intent of this ruling is to avoid unintended rule GS6 *Penalties* for a small movement of a *Cone* stack caused by a *Robot* that is simply playing the game (i.e., removing the top *Cone* from the stack). This ruling does not allow gameplay actions or strategies that incrementally move the *Cone* stack to a more desirable location.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">216</span> A scored “skinny” beacon is not seen by the referee crew</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Our team designed a “skinny” beacon so it can be easily placed by the human player onto a cone in the substation. When the cone and beacon combination is scored on a junction, it can be difficult to see the beacon. We are concerned the referee crew may not always see our scored beacon. Question 1: What happens if the referee crew doesn’t see the scored beacon? Question 2: What happens if the referee crew doesn’t see the beacon and the opposing alliance scores their cone over over our beacon?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer 1: Referees record *Scoring* task achievements and apply game rules based on gameplay that they see. A *Scored Beacon* that is not visible to the referee crew has zero *Score* value, does not convey *Junction Ownership* to the *Alliance*, etc. The *Match* will be scored as if the obscured or difficult to see *Beacon* does not exist. Simply stated, if a referee didn't see it, it didn't happen. 

It is the *Team's* responsibility to follow the guidance stated in Game Manual Part 1 rule TE01: "The purpose of this [*Beacon* color] rule is to ensure that field personnel, *Teams*, and the audience can easily associate *Team Scoring Elements* [*Beacons*] with their corresponding *Alliance*." The Game Design Committee's intent for this statement is that *Beacon* designs need to be readily visible with sufficient color surface area to be easily seen.

Answer 2: Same as answer #1. The playing field is scored based on what the referee crew is able to see from their normal locations outside the *Playing Field*. If a referee didn't see the "skinny" *Beacon,* the *Playing Field* is scored as if the *Beacon* does not exist.

Note 1: It is highly unlikely that a discussion with the Head Referee in the question box will change a final *Match* score because a "skinny" *Beacon* was not seen by the referee crew.

Note 2: *Beacon* inspection does not include a visibility test and we are not going to add such a test. A *Beacon* that passes inspection can still be difficult for the referee crew to see, depending how it is used during gameplay. Just like a legally constructed *Robot* can use an assembly in an illegal way (e.x., grab a *Junction* pole), a legal *Beacon* that is difficult to see, may not be counted as *Scored*.

Pro Tip: Design a *Beacon* that is highly visible when *Scored* on a *Junction*. Make it easy for the referee crew and the other *Drive Teams* to see.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">220</span> Clarification of Q192 and Q215 Regarding Universal Parts</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In the CODEX bundle, there is some gray area on what parts are universal. Here are the relevant parts in the bundle: shorturl.at/AENQ1.

The main concern is the wheel inserts pictured above the omni wheel. They mount the omni wheel to universal shaft standards.

The design behind the inserts was created by FTC 16379, for a different open source odometry pod (BabyOdo).

These parts can be used outside an odometry pod in order to mount this wheel. Are these wheel inserts legal?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Based on the description of the wheel inserts provided in the question, they should be classified the same as the Axon Robotics custom COTS side plates that are addressed in !Q171, !Q173 and !Q215.

The wheel inserts contained in the Axon Robotics CODEX bundle are not allowed for robot construction.

Note: We understand that some teams may have already incorporated the illegal parts from the CODEX bundle in their *Robot*. Since there are other legal ways to build an equivalent odometry module, the use of these illegal parts for a limited time do not provide an unfair competitive advantage. Therefore, the Game Design Committee is allowing a grace period for teams participating in events that are about to happen. *Teams* may continue to use the illegal CODEX bundle parts through December 31, 2022. Starting January 1, 2023, the illegal CODEX bundle parts may not be used for *Robot* construction.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In Q161, the team said their robot is pushing the junction pole at an angle of about 5 degrees. It is ruled legal. Can GDC further define "What is necessary to Score"? Can the team use either their robot element or cone to push the pole at 10, 20, or 30 degrees? Is it up to the referee to decide at the particular event? There won't be any ruling consistency cross events. Legally bending the pole at a larger angle even with one point of contact in autonomous will definitely have an advantage.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">While we understand the wish for a simple metric, we believe that there is no "one size fits" all type of definition that is reasonable.

The definition of "what is necessary to score" depends very much on the robot, the skill of the drivers and the other factors on the field at the time of the scoring.

Teams that deflect poles repeatedly and significantly should expect additional scrutiny. Deflection that is deemed excessive (either in angle or duration) will likely cause discussion about either G25 Grasping or G29 Illegal Use of Game Elements violations.</span>

Also, a rule G26 violation for damage to the *Cone* is possible, depending on the circumstances.

Note: The recommend method for placing a *Beacon* onto a *Cone In* the *Substation* is for the *Human Player* to drop the *Beacon* onto the *Cone*.

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Your questions and comments were previously addressed in !Q204. 

If you have a question about *Penalties* applied to the movement of an *Alliance's* own *Cone* stack during *Match* play, use the question box to have a chat with the Head Referee about how rule GS6 was applied. Discussing post !Q204 should inform the conversation about how to determine allowed and illegal movement of an *Alliance's* own *Cone* stack.

Answer 1: No. Lateral movement of an upright *Cone* stack is not the same as knocking over a *Cone* stack.

Answer 2: Lateral movement of an *Alliance's* own *Cone* stack that is one (1) inch or less is allowed as stated in !Q204. Lateral movement of a *Cone* stack that is more than one (1) inch is *Penalized* per rule GS6.a. Whether or not the movement o the *Cone* stack was intentional or unintentional is not relevant to the application of rule GS6. The Head Referee does not have the option to use rule G10 when the *Cone* stack is moved more than one (1) inch because the Game Design Committee in !Q204 stated that this amount of movement is consequential.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">280</span> Clarification on score dispute and what a team can ask a head referee.</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Can you clarify what a team can dispute regarding their score? An alliance team member approached the head referee BEFORE the score was finalized because there were concerns that they had not been scored for completing the circuit. The Head Referee didn't answer the question and walked away. The final score was incorrect. What recourse do alliances have when they are not receiving the correct score? This is not the first time this season that scores have been incorrect.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There is a time and a place to ask questions of the Head Referee.  At the field and before the scores of a match are finalized is neither!

C02 outlines the process for asking questions of the Head Referee.

All questions/challenges should be asked in the question box. They should be asked within 3 matches following the match in question.

The process is designed to move questions away from the field and to a time that does not interfere with the ability to reset the field.

There is no limit to what can be asked. Just remember to be gracious.

It is important to remember that the referees at an event have final gameplay and scoring authority during the event.

When you ask your questions, be prepared to provide specific information about what you believe was wrong.  The head referee will, if they feel it is appropriate, confer with their crew and make a decision based on the collective input from the crew.  Recognize that the decision of the head referee is the final decision.

One other item you may not be aware of is that the live scoring system freezes the scores on the field and audience displays once the scoring referees begin the final match review portion of their inputs.  Frequently, there are changes to the final score based on inputs from the other referee (penalties, confirmed counts, etc)</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A single point of *Robot* contact with a *Junction* pole is not illegal grabbing of a *Game Element*.

The description of the *Robot* appendage appears to prevent it from grabbing a *Junction* pole. However, the minimal pole clearance between the two dowels may be difficult for the referee crew to see during gameplay and lead to the application of rule G25 consequences. Demonstrating to the referee crew how the *Robot* interacts with the *Junction* pole before the first qualification match of the day is recommended.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In Q204 it says: "For the Cone stacks only, the Game Design Committee rules that movement of one inch or less is inconsequential and therefore, does not violate rule GS6." 

At an event the head referee told us that if we move the cone stack 1/2" when interact with it and then move it back 1/2" when we interact with it again later that we have violated the 1" rule.  Can you further clarify this?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Rule GS6.a consequences for moving the *Alliance's Cone* stack are applied when the position of an upright *Cone*  stack has moved to a location that is more than one (1) inch from its pre-*Match* set up starting location.

Moving the *Cone* stack 1/2 inch away from its starting location and in a separate interaction, moving the *Cone* stack 1/2 inch back to its pre-*Match* set up starting location has maintained the *Cone* stack within the one (1) inch movement allowance. Therefore, this scenario is not a rule GS6.a violation per !Q204.

Note: A *Robot* that moves its *Alliance's Cone* stack more than one (1) inch from its pre-*Match* starting location in a single or cumulative movements violates rule GS6a. Once a referee assigns a rule GS6 *Penalty*, moving the *Cone* stack back to its pre-*Match* starting location does not undoo (i.e., reverse) the previously applied *Penalty*.</span>

The *Robot* in this scenario is *Controlling* one *Cone* over the rule GS6.a *Control/Possession* limit. The *Robot* should receive an immediate *Minor Penalty* for the excess *Cone* and an additional *Minor Penalty* for each additional 5-second interval that this situation continues. For the described scenario, the 10-second GS6.a rule violation adds up to three (3) *Minor Penalties*. 

In addition, *Scoring* a *Cone* while it *Controls* more than the allowed quantity of *Cones* results in an additional *Minor Penalty* per *Scored Cone* as described in rule GS6.d.

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q125 describes red robot using a long reach to the Substation from tiles (in/around Y3), blue attempting to score on Z3 junction.  Red yields to Blue.

Last sentence of answer: Blue must equally "yield access to ... Junction(s) / Terminal in a timely manner", but is silent on yielding access to the *Substation* .

Can the blue robot use extended-time scoring attempts on Z3 to delay red robot's use of long reach to the Substation?  If referee determines delay, what penalties apply?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The ultimate decision for applying rule GS12 consequences for *Blocking* access to the opposing *Alliance's Substation* would be determined by the referee watching gameplay, with the final call made by the Head referee.

Rule GS12 is clear about how the referee crew will address a *Robot* that *Blocks* access to the opposing *Alliance's Substation*. Rule GS12 states in part: "The first instance will result in a *Warning* with any following violations resulting in a *Major Penalty* and an additional *Minor Penalty* assessed for every five seconds that the rule violation persists. If the referee declares a *Blocking* access *Warning*, the offending *Robot* must move away at least 3 feet (0.9 m), approximately 1.5 floor *Tiles* from the *Blocked Substation*. Failure to move the required 3 feet (0.9 m) within 5 seconds is considered an additional violation and will incur the *Penalties* described above. Additional occurrences of violations of this rule will escalate to *Yellow Cards* quickly.</span>

	<b>A:</b>

It is difficult, if not impossible to make a correct determination by viewing a photo of a limited portion of the *Playing Field*. *Robot* actions leading up to the point in time that this photo was taken may also impact how the referee crew applies the appropriate rules.

Based on the limited text description of the *Robot* actions, per rule GS3, no *Penalty* should be assessed because the *Robots* interactions occurred at the centerline *Junctions*.

The referee crew will use the dictionary definition of "centerline" when applying rule GS3 to *Autonomous Period* gameplay.

Note: *Teams* that make use of *Autonomous Period* gameplay strategies that include *Robot* navigation near the centerline *Junctions* risk incurring allowed disruptions caused by other *Robots* that are simply playing the game in the same part of the *Playing Field*.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In Q288 it is stated that a robot apparatus interacting with a junction pole must have a radius larger than the base of a cone in order to not be considered grasping. Unclear is a situation where the robot apparatus never braces a cone and only interacts with a pole: 
1) Would an arc shaped apparatus with a 3" diameter, which under no circumstances can touch a pole at more than one point, and at any given moment is not contacting a cone, be legal?
2) If not, what rule does this violate and why?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We believe !Q288 answers your question. If it does not, please rephrase your question and resubmit.

For the POWERPLAY game, the Game Design Committee selected the *Cone* radius as a measuring tool for determining if a curved robot part can legally contact (i.e., without grasping) a *Junction* pole because a *Cone* is readily available to *Teams*, robot inspectors, and referees.

Answer 1: An single arc shaped *Robot* apparatus that has a radius greater than the radius of a *Cone* is declared by the Game Design Committee to be unable to grasp the *Junction* pole and therefore does not violate rule G25 when it contacts a *Junction* pole. 

The definition of *Cone* in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 states that the diameter of the *Cone* base is four (4) inches. The radius of the *Cone* base is therefore two (2) inches. A *Robot* apparatus with a radius greater than two (2) inches is deemed to be unable to grasp the *Junction* pole. A *Robot* apparatus with a two (2) inch or smaller radius that contacts a *Junction* is grasping and violates rule G25.

The *Robot* described in this question with a three (3) inch diameter (1.5 inch radius) apparatus violates rule G25 when it contacts a *Junction* pole.

Answer 2: Rule G25 is violated for the reasons specified in Answer #1 above.</span>

	<span name="question">With the flood of questions about legal Junction contact, it makes sense to have an easy metric. However, many teams have passive scoring mechanisms that work only because arc greater than the diameter of a Junction can be less than the radius of a Cone. A) Are teams expected to completely redesign their scoring mechanism to accommodate this rule change? B) Could a smaller radius (IE the top of the cone) be used? C) if A, will there be a grace period for teams to redesign?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer A: Yes, *Robot* contact with a *Junction* pole with an arc shaped appendage that has a radius less than or equal to a *Cone* base violates rule G25.

Allowing arc shaped *Robot* appendages with a radius greater than the *Cone* base radius is a relaxation of the grasping guidance provided in !Q55. For this one application, the Game Design Committee decided to relax the grasping rule because a shallow arc, even though it is technically grasping the pole, is unlikely to cause any damage or large sideways deflections of the pole during gameplay. 

Answer B: No.

Answer 1: The *Cones* are still valid and counted. 

Answer 2: This scenario has two rule violations:

a) Each *Scored Cone* while the *Robot Controls* or *Possesses* more than the allowed one (1) *Cone*will result in a *Minor Penalty* per *Scored Cone* per rule GS6.d.

b) Rule GS6.a consequences for *Possessing* more than one *Cone* at a time also apply. *Controlling* or *Possessing* more than the allowed quantity of *Cones* is an immediate *Minor Penalty* for each *Scoring Element* above the limit plus an additional *Minor Penalty* per *Scoring Element* in excess of the limit for each 5-second interval that this situation continues.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">After initialization, a team noticed the camera is not "seeing" the signal sleeve because the cone may be rotated or moved along the floor tape in such a way that prevents the robot camera from seeing the sleeve. May a team request the field ref to move/rotate the cone until the robot camera can "see" the sleeve? Does the field ref have to fulfill the request?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answers to the questions depends on when the *Drive Team* asks Field Personnel for assistance as described below.

A) During Pre-*Match Robot* set up:

*Signal*: During Pre-*Match Robot* set up, the *Drive Team* may ask an FTA, FTAA, or referee to reposition the *Signal* so that it is centered on the location tape and Image #1 is facing the the correct direction towards the *Alliance Station Wall*. Upon request, Field Personnel are expected to correct *Playing Field* setup errors per rule G12. This is also the appropriate time to notify Field Personnel about any *Playing Field* set up concerns.

*Signal Sleeve*: The *Drive Team* is responsible for placing their *Signal Sleeve* onto the *Signal* with "Team Image 1" facing the associated *Alliance Station* as stated in section 4.4.1 2).d in Game Manual Part 2. The *Drive Team* may adjust an incorrectly placed *Signal Sleeve* as it sits on the *Signal,* up until the time that the referee crew notifies *Drive Teams* that the *Playing Field* is "frozen."

B) After the *Playing Field* is "frozen" by the referee crew, the *Drive Team* may ask a referee to adjust the position of the *Signal/Signal Sleeve*. The referee may comply with the request, however the referee is not required to adjust the *Signal/Signal Sleeve* between the times when the "*Playing Field* is frozen" announcement is made and before the *Signal/Signal Sleeve* is adjusted for the randomized orientation for the *Match*.

Note: Referees, are expected to maintain the *Signal/Signal Sleeve's* centered location on the tape and to orient the appropriate image towards the *Alliance Station Wall* during *Playing Field* randomization. Randomization repositioning is not a precise operation. Rulers, protractors, lasers, alignment tools, etc. are not used to reposition the *Signal/Signal Sleeve*. *Robots* should be designed to accommodate expected small deviations of *Signal/Signal Sleeve* positioning. *Drive Teams* should immediately notify the referee crew if an error is made during *Signal/Signal Sleeve* randomization movement. Upon timely notification, Field Personnel are expected to remediate an incorrectly randomized *Signal/Signal Sleeve* before the *Match* starts.</span>

Answer 1: Per !Q222, while we understand the wish for a simple metric, we believe that there is no "one size fits" all type of definition that is reasonable.

The definition of "what is necessary to score" depends very much on the robot, the skill of the drivers and the other factors on the field at the time of the scoring.

Using the pole deflection "outside the cylinder defined by the washer" is not a valid one size fits all metric for determining the legality of a deflected *Junction* pole.</span>

	<span name="answer">The G28 *Pinning, Trapping,* or *Blocking Robots* rule will be applied in this gameplay scenario.

The referee should notify *Robot* A's *Drive Team* and start their count at 2, since by the time the count is started, at least one second has gone by. *Robot* A must back off a minimum of 36 inches by the count of 5 to avoid being penalized. If *Robot* A does not back up in a timely manner or far enough away, the referee should assign a *Minor Penalty* for every five seconds until *Robot* A has moved at least 36 inches away from *Robot* B.

Due to the strategic importance of the *Substation*, continued use of this defensive strategy will escalate quickly to a"Yellow Card* and a possible rule G30 rule violation for egregious gameplay.</span>

Answer 2: A nonfunctional *Robot* that has not been declared to be *Disabled* by a referee is eligible to earn points. How the *Robot* ended up in a *Scoring Area* does not affect its *Score* value. There is not a rule that specifically prevents a *Robot* from pushing a nonfunctional opposing *Alliance Robot*.

	<span name="question">1. While you are moving a disabled robot, it should be "part of" your Robot based on the definition of "Control". Could penalties under G28/GS8 apply if you leave the disabled robot someplace that later becomes a concern after you are no longer controlling it?

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer 1: First of all, this is an overly broad application of the defined term "*Control*".

The Game Design Committee discussed many options for determining how to determine when *Cone Stack* moment is consequential. Using the *Cone Stack* location tape was one option that we considered. All things considered, the Game Design Committed selected the one (1) inch movement guidance in !Q204.

Note: The rule G8 +/- one (1) inch *Playing Field* tolerance should not come into play for the *Cone Stack* location. The orange box notice for rule G8 states:

"*Playing Field* and *Game Elements* are expected to be manufactured, assembled, and set up using a high standard for dimensional and location accuracy. The intent of the generous +/- 1.0 inch tolerance is to accommodate unintentional size and location variations that may occur. The tolerance is not an excuse for intentional or imprecise accuracy in construction or setup."

If a *Cone Stack* is not in the correct location during *Pre-Match Robot* set up, the *Drive Team* may ask an FTA, FTAA, or referee to reposition the *Cone Stack* so that it is in the correct location. Upon request, field personnel are expected to correct *Playing Field* setup errors per rule G12. This is also the appropriate time to notify field personnel about any *Playing Field* set up concerns.</span>

Thank you - KB</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The Game Design Committee will not provide additional bespoke guidance for the !Q335 type scenarios. Referees watching gameplay are in the best position to apply the simple rule G28 constraints and consequences. 

Reminder: The rule G28 five (5) second count is not permission to violate the rule for just under 5 seconds. *Teams* are expected to back their *Robots* away from *Pinning/Trapping/Blocking* situations as soon as the initial count begins. The 5 second count is a grace period to allow the *Robot* back away to fully take place.

Attempts to avoid G28 consequences by repeated use of the five (5) second grace period should result in the application of G28 *Penalties* and G30 consequences for repeatedly violating rule G28.

The *Substation* is a small and very important *Alliance Specific Area* on the *Playing Field*. *Robots* should be careful when operating near an opposing *Alliance's Substation*. Rule violations near the opposing *Alliance's Substation* should be enforced rigidly and quickly.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">348</span> Follow up to Q26, Grasping a junction</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In Q26, it was qualified with "intent to limit its (the junction) motion".  Our claw mechanism will lower the cone onto the junction, then open to drop the cone the rest of the way.  If we close the claw before we completely lift back up above the junction, then our claw will technically close around the junction.  The intention was not to "limit motion", it was just inadvertent game play after scoring an element.  Is this a violation of G25?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer depends upon what the *Robot's* actions after closing the claw around the *Junction* pole.

1) The *Robot's* closed claw does not contact the *Junction* pole: Rule G25 is not violated because grasping requires contact with the object. 

2) The *Robot's* closed claw contacts the *Junction* pole: A closed *Robot* claw contacting the *Junction* pole is grasping. The referee crew will determine if rule G25 is violated and apply the appropriate consequences. The referee crew will likely excuse a *Robot's* careful attempt to withdraw the claw without grasping, provided that there is negligible movement of the *Junction* pole and the *Junction* pole is not damaged.

Example Scenarios: a) Rule G25 is not violated if the *Robot* opens the claw and backs away without contacting the *Junction* pole.

b) Rule G25 is not violated if the *Robot* raises the closed claw so that it is clear of the *Junction* pole without contacting the *Junction* pole before the *Robot* moves away from the *Junction*.

c) Rule G25 is violated if the *Robot* backs away and the closed claw contacts the *Junction* pole. The referee crew may choose to use rule G10 to excuse this violation if they view the *Robot's* interaction with the *Junction* pole as being *Inadvertent* and *Inconsequential*. A *Robot* that usually interacts with the *Junction* in this manner should not be deemed to be *Inadvertently* grasping and shall be *Penalized* for violating rule G25.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Yes, the recommended action at this point time in the match play sequence is to alert the referee crew. The Head Referee will decide how to proceed.

Note: This is a great question. The *Drive Team* should immediately notify field personnel whenever there is a technical problem with their *Robot*, *Robot* Wi-Fi communication, *Driver Station*, etc. Even when the *Drive Team* knows how to remediate the problem at hand, it is in the *Team’s* best interest to alert field personnel. An experienced *FIRST* Technical Advisor (FTA), or FTA Assistant can quickly diagnose the problem and know what actions to take to get the *Robot* back into action. Many *Robot* issues can be addressed without touching the *Robot*. For the times during gameplay that direct interaction with the *Robot* is necessary, but is not allowed, the FTA or FTAA can explain to the *Drive Team* what went wrong and how to fix the *Robot* after the *Match*.

During *Pre-Match Robot* set up, the field technical crew should be close at hand and available to assist teams upon request. Once the field technical crew releases the *Playing Field* to the referee crew, alert field personnel by loudly asking for the “FTA” and gesturing expressively with their arms and hands. This alerts both the field technical and referee crews that a *Robot* is in distress. 

The FTA, during *Pre-Match* setup, has the flexibility to take extra time to address *Robot* issues. Once the FTA releases the playing field to the referee crew, the Head Referee has absolute control over how to proceed when *Robot* issues arise.</span>

From the Game Manual: A *Cone* is *Secured* in a *Low, Medium,* or *High Junction* when the pole passes through the 1.25 inch diameter hole of the *Cone* or it is *Completely On* a *Secured Cone*. A *Cone* is *Secured* only if the large opening is facing toward the *Playing Field Floor.*

Answer 1: Yes, the pole passes through the 1.25 inch diameter hole of the *Cone* and the large opening of the *Cone* is facing towards the *Playing Field Floor.*

Answer 2: Yes, if the large opening is primarily facing toward the *Playing Field Floor.*

	<h2>Q<span name="number">375</span> Clarification of defensive strategy in front of Substation</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">1) Redbot goes to B3/B4, extends to occupy tiles B5,B4,B3,B2, and remains stationary, creating significant obstacle for Blue Robots to access their Substation and select *Junctions*. 2) Same as #1, but Redbot also occupies tile B6. Is Redbot at risk of penalties; if so, which ones?

We believe these defensive strategies are not likely to be the spirit of the game or FTC. We ask because we cannot find rule/forum text that clearly limits such gameplay and seek guidance on its legality.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Yes, the red *Alliance Robot* is at risk of incurring *Penalties* as described below.

a) Substation: The ultimate decision for applying rule GS12 consequences for *Blocking* access to the opposing *Alliance's Substation* would be determined by the referee watching gameplay, with the final call made by the Head referee.

Rule GS12 is clear about how the referee crew will address a *Robot* that *Blocks* access to the opposing *Alliance's Substation*. Rule GS12 states in part: "The first instance will result in a Warning with any following violations resulting in a *Major Penalty* and an additional *Minor Penalty* assessed for every five seconds that the rule violation persists. If the referee declares a *Blocking* access *Warning*, the offending *Robot* must move away at least 3 feet (0.9 m), approximately 1.5 floor *Tiles* from the *Blocked Substation*. Failure to move the required 3 feet (0.9 m) within 5 seconds is considered an additional violation and will incur the *Penalties* described above. Additional occurrences of violations of this rule will escalate to *Yellow Cards* quickly.

The *Substation* is a small and very important *Alliance Specific Area* on the *Playing Field*. *Robots* should be careful when operating near an opposing *Alliance's Substation*. Rule violations near the opposing *Alliance's Substation* should be enforced rigidly and quickly.

b) Junction: *Blocking* access to a *Junction*, and impeding or obstructing an opposing *Alliance Robot* from *Scoring* a *Cone* on a *Junction* were previously addressed by !Q10, !Q121, !Q209, !Q125, and !Q213.</span>

Similarly, if a junction has a large number of cones on it from from one or both alliances and an additional cone or a cap causes the junction to tip over, will the alliance that placed the last cone or cap on the junction be charged with descoring?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We believe !Q14 and !Q58 answers your questions in part. Further information is provided below.

Answer 1: All of the *Cones* are descored. If the referee crew attributes the tipped *Junction* pole to an *Alliance*, that *Alliance* is *Penalized* for descoring the opposing *Alliance Cones* per rule GS5.a. There is no *Penalty* for descoring your own *Alliance's Cone*.

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Team A is using extending mechanisms and is obstructing the shortest path to a junction, but still provides alternate paths that are far longer and more inconvenient for Team B based on their current position.

1) Is Team B allowed to push through when Team A is not in possession of a cone knowing there will likely be contact involved? 
2) What about when Team A is already in possession of a cone but the cone is not yet in a Junction Area?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer 1: A *Robot* deploying “extending mechanisms” is responsible for operating safely and accepts an increased risk of becoming damaged. In this scenario, Team B is allowed to “push through”, provided that it doesn’t cause undue damage to Team A’s *Robot*. For example, extending a flimsy mechanism with the objective of restricting movement of an opposing *Alliance Robot* is likely to become damaged with no *Penalty* consequences applied to the opposing *Alliance Robot*.

The *Substation* is a small, constrained, strategic *Area* that is a critical part of game flow.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">380</span> Follow up to Q300</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">This question assumes the scenario stated Q300 with one key difference. In this new version the red alliance robot drives from tile F2, crosses the centerline, either moving partly, or completely, into tile C2, and attempts to score. The position of the red robot prevents the blue alliance robot from moving all, or part, of its robot from tile C3 to C1, preventing the blue alliance robot from accessing the cone stack located in tile C1.  Are the red alliance's actions illegal?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Rule GS3 disallows *Autonomous Period* interference, except for interactions at the centerline which are explicitly not considered as interference. Once the *Robot* is across the centerline, interactions are no longer at the centerline and therefore not protected.

The application of rule GS3 in the scenarios described in the question is dependent upon the red *Alliance Robot's* location and actions. For example:

Scenario 1: A red *Alliance Robot Completely In Tile* C2 is no longer at the centerline and is therefore subject to rule GS3 consequences if it interferes with the opposing *Alliance's Scoring* attempts during the *Autonomous Period*.

Scenario 2: A red *Alliance Robot In Tiles* C2 and D2 is at the *Playing Field* centerline and is therefore protected from rule GS3 consequences for interfering with the opposing *Alliance's Scoring* attempts during the *Autonomous Period*, unless the referee crew views the red *Alliance Robot's* actions as an intentional defensive strategy. Intentional defensive strategies at the centerline are not protected by the rule GS3 exception for interactions at the centerline.</span>

An object is *Possessed* by a *Robot* if, as the *Robot* moves or changes orientation (for example, moves forward, turns, backs up, spins in place), the object remains in approximately the same position relative to the *Robot*.

	<span name="question">If an opposing alliance cone is sitting on top of a junction in a manner it is not secure as shown in diagram F-11 of appendix F and a robot attempts to knock it off so they can score on that junction and the cone starts to slide down the pole in the process, but never comes to rest prior to being knocked off, would that be considered descoring?  I have a short video of the scenario I'm trying to describe if that would be helpful</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Yes, the *Robot* in this scenario descores the *Cone*.

The *Cone* in this scenario satisfies the definition of *Secured* in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2. Removing a *Secured Cone* from a *Junction* is descoring and violates rule GS4a.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">392</span> Does touching a scored cone with the robot constitute a point of contact with the junction</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The team is using a rule-compliant "funnel" device to touch a junction near the top of the junction, but occasionally the robot is also contacting a previously-scored cone on that junction at the bottom. Q1: Does that constitute 2 points of contact and hence illegal? Q2: Also could such an event be construed as possessing/controlling 2 cones?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer 1: We believe !Q26 answers your question. If it does not, please rephrase your question and resubmit.

Illegal grasping has two or more points of *Robot* contact that apply opposing force to a *Junction* pole.

The *Robot* in the scenario described in the question appears to have two points of contact that are not opposing each other. Therefore, the *Robot* is not grasping the *Junction* pole.

Answer 2: No, rule GS6.e.i allows a *Robot* to temporarily *Brace Scored Cones* belonging to either *Alliance* while placing a *Scoring Element* onto those *Cones.* The *Braced Cones* in this *Scoring* scenario are not subject to the *Control/Possession* limit.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">393</span> Wire Gauge Requirements for COTS LED Light Strip</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Game Manual 1 <RE15> specifies the minimum wire gauges for power, motor, servo, encoder, and sensor wires. Is there a minimum wire gauge for COTS light sources?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">*Robots* should use the following wire gauge size guidance for LED light sources:

1st: Follow the manufacturer's recommendation. For example, the REV Blinkin LED Driver ships with a 24 AWG LED adapter cable, *Robots* may use 24 AWG or larger (e.g., 22 AWG, 20 AWG, 18 AWG, etc.) wires to connect their compatible LEDs to the REV LED adapter cable.

2nd: If the manufacturer does not specify a recommendation and the LED or LED strip has wires attached, use the same or larger size as the wires provided by the manufacturer.

3nd: If there are no attached wires and the LED manufacturer does not recommend a wire gauge, use the following guidance: a) 5V LEDs: 22 AWG or larger; b) 12V LEDs: 18 AWG or larger.</span>
