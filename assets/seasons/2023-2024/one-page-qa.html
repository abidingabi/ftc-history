	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">When having a discussion of the rules about the backdrop and drones. Several students questioned what would happen if a drone went back and hit the backdrop and knocked down pixels of the opposite alliance. Would there be a penalty for the drone hitting the backdrop.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The *Pixel* descoring rule, GS04, applies to this gameplay scenario. A *Minor Penalty* will be assessed for each *Pixel* descored from the opposing *Alliance's Backdrop*.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">2</span> Spitting out a third pixel</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Per rule <GS05> robots can’t possess/control more than 2 pixels, and doing so results in a minor penalty for each additional pixel as well as another minor penalty after every 5 seconds.

Q1: We were wondering if there is an exception to be made for intaking a 3rd pixel and immediately spitting it back out.

Q2: Additionally, if such an exception is the case, are there limitations on our actions while the 3rd pixel is in our possession/control? (ex. driving)</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Yes there is an exception. The *Robot* in this scenario is unlikely to be *Penalized* for *Controlling* too many *Pixels*. The referee should view the *Robot's* actions as being both *Inadvertent* and *Inconsequential* and not call a rule GS05 *Penalty* as allowed by rule G10.

A2: Yes, for this scenario, there are limitations to being excused for a rule GS05 *Penalty*. The *Robot* is unlikely to receive a rule GS05 *Penalty* if the *Robot* satisfies the following two conditions: 1) It ejects the extra *Pixel* in a reasonable amount of time and; 2) It refrains from playing the game while *Controlling* the extra *Pixel*. Two examples of playing the game are: a) Traveling to a different location and; b) Placing a *Pixel In* a *Scoring Area*. If the *Robot's* actions are clearly focused on removing the extra *Pixel* and not playing other aspects of the game, it is highly unlikely that it will receive a GS05 *Penalty".</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">5</span> <GS05> line c) Control/Possession limit exceptions:</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question"><GS05> line c):
i. Knocking over a stack ... Pixels is allowed.
ii. Inadvertent and Inconsequential movement of a pre-set stack of unscored Pixels is allowed. Moving the stack Completely Off the tape is considered consequential.
iii. Plowing through ... is allowed.
Q1: Does the "Moving the stack Completely Off the tape" apply to the entire stack, or is a single pixel on the stack able to be moved  past the tape edge? Q2: If knocking over, can more than one pixel?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The intent of Rule GS05.c.(i&ii) is to allow reasonable *Robot* interaction with a *Pixel* stack without violating the *Pixel Control/Possession* limits described in rule GS05.a. The Rule GS05.c.i exception is for *Pixel(s)* knocked off of a stack and onto the *Playing Field Floor*. The Rule GS05c.ii exception is for the movement of three (3) or more of the pre-set stacked *Pixels* as a group that stay *On* the white tape line.

A1: Penalizing the movement of the *Pixel* stack applies when three (3) or more stacked *Pixels* are moved all together *Off* of the white tape line. Moving a "single *Pixel* from the stack past the tape edge" is allowed because it is less than the two (2) *Pixel Controller/Possession* limit described in rule GS05.a.

A2: Yes, the rule GS05.c.i exemption applies to any number of *Pixels* knocked off of the stack onto the *Playing Field Floor*. The knocked off *Pixels* are not subject to rule GS05.a constraints, even if they come to rest *Off* of the white tape line.

**Bonus Information:** *Pixels* in the pre-set stacks can't be *Propelled* per rule GS10.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">13</span> GS05 - Robot Control/Possession Limits for Pixels</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Please explain if these scenarios will be penalized:
Q1: Robot knocks a pixel stack down (GS05.c.i). These pixels are such that they are no longer stacked and are scattered singles.
Q2: Robot pushes 3/4/5 of the knocked down pixels into the backstage (GS05.c.iii).
Q3: The restriction seems to be, a robot can not move a stack of 3 or more pixels from the white line.
Q4: Scattered / knocked off pixels can be plowed. Is that accurate?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: No *Penalty*. Rule GS05.c.i allows a *Robot* to knock over a stack of unscored *Pixels*.

A2: The *Robot* will be penalized for violating rule GS05.a because it is *Controlling* more than two (2) *Pixels*. The *Pixels* in this scenario are *Herded*, a form of *Control*, by the *Robot* because the *Pixels* are pushed to a desired location that gains a strategic advantage beyond the *Robot* moving around the *Playing Field*. The *Pixels* in this scenario do not qualify for the rule GS05.c.iii exception for *Plowing*. See the definitions of "*Herding*" and "*Plowing*" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 to fully understand the difference between these game-specific terms. 

A3: Correct, a *Robot* will be penalized for moving a stack of three (3) or more *Pixels Off* of the white tape line per rules GS05.a and GS05c.ii.

A4: Yes, any quantity of "scattered/knocked off *Pixels*" can be *Plowed* per rule GS05.c.iii. See the definition of "*Plowing*" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 to gain an understanding of how to apply this game-specific term.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">14</span> Launching Pixels</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Launching is defined as "Propelling Game Elements through the air or water above the Playing Field Floor." 

Q1: Are Pixels considered launched if they stay in contact with the floor? 

Q2: In other words, can be slid along the floor and not be considered Launched and if so, are there any constraints in how far they can go?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">An understanding of the game-specific defined terms "*Propel/Propelling*", "*Launch/Launching*", and "*Slide/Sliding*" found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 is necessary to fully understand Q1, Q2, and their answers. Please take a moment to review these definitions before proceeding. 

The "bonus information" following answers A1 and A2 addresses a related gameplay scenario that complements Q1 and Q2.

A1: No, a *Pixel* that is "in contact with the floor" does not satisfy the definition of "*Launched*" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2.

A2: A *Pixel* "slid along the floor" does not satisfy the definition of "*Launched*" because the *Pixel* remains in contact with the "Playing Field Floor".

**Bonus Information:** Rule GS10 states that *Pixels* may not be *Propelled*. Each violation of this rule results in a *Minor Penalty*. To understand how to apply rule GS10 to *Pixels* that are *Slid* by a *Robot*, we need to review the definitions of "*Sliding*" and "*Propelling*".

"*Sliding*" is defined as *Propelling Game Elements* along the *Playing Field Floor*. 

"*Propelling*" is giving *Game Elements* enough force such that they move independent of contact with the *Robot* or *Human Player*. *Launching*, *Rolling*, and *Sliding* are forms of *Propelling*. 

Since "*Sliding*" is a form of "*Propelling*", a *Robot* causing a *Pixel* to *Slide* violates rule GS10.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">16</span> Drone Launching</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">How is "over" defined for the purpose of <4.4.4.2> "Launched Drones must pass over the Truss and/or Stage Door for each scoring attempt to earn points."

Specifically, does the drone need to be fully clear of touching its launching robot before the leading edge of the drone passes the plane over the Rigging or before the trailing edge leaves the plane above the Rigging?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A *Robot* must release  the *Drone* (i.e, no *Drone* contact with the *Robot*) before any part of the *Drone* passes over the *Rigging* or top pole of the *Stage Door*.

The following text demonstrates how to use the Game Manual to substantiate the answer.

The answer to the question is found by applying the game-specific definitions of "*Launch/Launching*" and "*Propel/Propelling*" found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 to rule GS11.e.

Rule GS11.e states that "for each scoring attempt (*Launch*, fly, land), a *Launched Drone* must pass over a *Rigging* or top pole of the *Stage Door* before it is eligible to *Score* points. The key point is that the *Drone* must be *Launched* before passing over the specified *Game Elements*. Next, we need to understand and apply the definition of "*Launch*."

"*Launch/Launching*" is defined as *Propelling Game Elements* through the air or water above the *Playing Field Floor*. Okay, now we need to review the definition of "*Propelling*."

"*Propel/Propelling*" is defined as giving *Game Elements* enough force such that they move independent of contact with the *Robot* or *Human Player*.

Therefore, a "*Launched*" *Drone* is no longer touching the *Robot*.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">18</span> Suspend at end of the match</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q1: Does a robot have to be suspended at the end of the match to count for suspend points? Q2: Does the robot still get the points for suspending if they suspend from the rigging at end game, make it obvious and unambiguous, and then come down off the rigging and go on the floor?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answers that you seek are found by reading the description of the *Robot* location tasks in Game Manual Part 2 section 4.4.4 *End Game*.

A1: Yes, to earn 20 points for being *Suspended from the Rigging*, a *Robot* must be *Suspended* from the *Rigging* when the scoring system *Match* timer reaches zero seconds (0:00) remaining in the *Match* or at some point during the end of *Match* sound played by the scoring system. After the *Match* ends, the *Robot* may remain *Suspended* or lower to the *Playing Field Floor* without affecting the previously earned 20 points for completing the *Suspended from the Rigging* achievement.

A2: No, a *Robot* located on the *Playing Field Floor* at the end of the *Match* (i.e., match time equals 0:00) does not satisfy the requirement of being *Suspended* by the *Rigging* at the *End of the Period*. However, there is still time to complete the scoring achievement; the *Robot Suspension* task may still occur, provided that the *Robot* is *Suspended* by the conclusion of the end of *Match* sound played by the scoring system.

**Note:** A1 and A2 were updated on November 6, 2023 to recognize that the end of *Match* buzzer length is a "grace period" for accomplishing the *Suspension* task.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">31</span> Are there any solutions/future plans to ensure metal field elements are grounded?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The middle metal poles holding the truss, rigging, and stage door seem to have no way of electrically grounding themselves to outside of the field, so when metal on the robot touches these elements, there is a static discharge that cannot be avoided by teams. <RG01> i) states robots cannot ground themselves to the playing field, and a grounding strap doesn't help. Will there be any rules that ensure competition fields are set up to remove static build-up on these poles?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">This may come as a shock (pun intended), but grounding the field may have the opposite effect that you intend. By grounding certain elements of the field you virtually guarantee that ESD shocks will be more intense and more frequent, as there will almost always be a large difference in potential between any floating object sliding/moving on the field (robot, game pieces, etc...) and the grounded elements. Understand also that the common wisdom of “touching metal” also doesn’t apply the same as it may have 5-6 years ago either - realize that virtually all aluminum extrusion on robots today is anodized, which is an electrically non-conducting coating on the extrusion. Older Tetrix anodized aluminum seems to have a thinner anodized layer, so it wears/scratches/rubs off more easily, and thus it was more likely that the aluminum would be electrically conductive and charge-accessible. This means you're not able to consistently rely on "metal" to "electrically connect" areas around the robot (i.e. thinking of the frame as a “wire” isn’t as applicable). Also the grounding strap is not meant to "ground" your robot, it's meant to attempt to equalize the potential between your electronics and areas of static build-up on the robot that the strap is connected to so that when ESD does happen the charge potential is hopefully small and thus has little to no effect. The [Managing ESD](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-esd.html) article on ftc-docs has several recommendations for how teams can protect their robots. No one solution is a silver bullet, though, careful attention is key!

You’ve asked about what event organizers are doing to reduce ESD buildup on the fields. Heavy Duty Staticide is a staple for treating fields, especially those that are at high risk for static charge buildup like areas with extremely low humidity. This Heavy Duty Staticide has been proven to be extremely effective at significantly reducing (or eliminating) static charge buildup.</span>

Q2: A robot knocks over the pixel stacks on the opposing alliance's half of the playing field and their robot is no longer able to pick them up in autonomous. Q3: Are any of these scenarios considered interference as long as my bot doesn't touch their bot or interfere with the randomization task scoring?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: This scenario violates the *Autonomous Interference* rule, GS03. 

A2: Knocking over a *Pixel* stack in the opposing *Alliance's* half of the *Playing Field* that affects an opposing *Alliance Robot* during the *Autonomous Period*, violates rule GS03.

A3: Yes, both of the scenarios in this question thread violate rule GS03, even though there is no direct *Robot* to *Robot* contact.

**Note**: These are great questions that may lead to the Game Design Committee adding clarifying text to the *Autonomous Period Interference* rule, GS03, in a future release of the Game Manual Part 2.

Randomization relocation is not a precision activity, *Teams* should design their *Team Prop* detection system to tolerate some change in orientation when it is relocated. The *Drive Team* should immediately alert field personnel if there is a significant change in the *Team Prop's* orientation.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">47</span> Moving pixels from spike marks</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q1: If the purple pixel is placed on the spike mark in the scoring position, but due to movement of robots doing other tasks, if it moves the pixel from the spike mark (alliance robot or opponent robot), how does the scoring work?

Q2: If the achievement score is determined right after autonomous, in the driver-controlled period, can we use that spike mark pixel for badkrop/backstage scoring purpose?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: *Autonomous Period* tasks are *Scored at Rest* per section 4.4.2 in Game Manual Part 2. "*Scored at Rest*" is defined in section 4.3 in Game Manual Part 2.  Applying the definition to the *Pixel* placed on the *Spike Mark*, the *Pixel* is considered to be *Scored* if it is *On* the designated (correct) *Spike Mark* when the entire field has come to rest after the *Autonomous Period* ends. 

In the Q1 scenario, the purple *Pixel* is not *On* the correct *Spike Mark*, therefore, the *Pixel's Score* value is zero.

There is no *Penalty* if a *Robot* descores its own *Alliance's Pixel*. Rule GS03 is violated If an opposing *Alliance Robot* descores the *Spike Mark Pixel*.

A2: Yes.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">50</span> Followup Q13</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">I am still not clear on Q13, as well as the how to apply rule GS05 in the game manual part 2.

1) GS05c. iii. - Plowing through any quantity of Scoring Elements is allowed.

2) GS05a. - Controlling or Possessing more than the allowed quantity of Scoring Elements is an immediate Minor Penalty.

I am looking for one example where plowing a robot through 3/4/5 elements does not violate rule GS05a, or does not belong to herding. I am unable to understand the use of GS05.c.iii.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Before proceeding with reading the following information, please review the game-specific definitions of the terms *Control*, *Possess*, *Herding*, and *Plowing* in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2. Applying the common or dictionary definitions of any game-specific term in section 4.3 may result in a misunderstanding of a scoring achievement requirement, rule, procedure, etc. Game-specific terms are easy to identify in the Game Manual because they have italics formatting and the first letter is capitalized. For example, the text "*Control*" has the correct formatting for a game-specific term. We strive to use this same formatting for defined terms contained in answers to gameplay questions in this forum.

Rule GS05.a limits the number of *Pixels* and *Drones* that a *Robot* can legally *Control* or *Possess*. This *Team's* question (!Q50) asks for an example of where *Plowing* through 3/4/5 *Pixels* does not violate rule GS05.a. The definition of *Control* specifically states that *Plowing* is not a form of *Control*. Therefore, all *Plowing* actions by a *Robot* do not violate the *Scoring Element Control/Possession* rule, GS05.a.

The second part of this *Team's* question asks for a *Plowing* scenario that is not *Herding*. Since *Plowing* actions and *Herding* actions are mutually exclusive, all *Plowing* actions are not *Herding*".

The following are gameplay examples that may be helpful:

Example 1: A *Robot* collects two *Pixels* from a *Pixel* stack. Since these are the only *Pixels Possessed* or *Controlled* by the *Robot*, rule GS05.a is not violated. The *Robot* drives directly through the *Truss* or *Stage Door* and stops *In* their *Alliance's Backstage*. Along the way to the *Backstage*, a stray *Pixel* on the *Playing Field Floor* is pushed by the *Robot* and it winds up *In* the *Backstage*. The *Robot* has now violated rule GS05.a because it *Possesses* two *Pixels* and it *Controlled* (*Herded*) the stray *Pixel* for a total of three (3) *Controlled Pixels*. The stray *Pixel* was *Herded* because it was moved to a location that provided the *Alliance* a strategic advantage since it was *Scored In* the *Backstage*.

Example 2: Same as Example 1, except when the *Robot* encounters the stray *Pixel*, it pushes the stray *Pixel* for a short distance. The *Drive Team* quickly realizes that the *Robot* just started to *Control* too many *Pixels*.  The *Drive Team* changes the *Robot's* direction of travel so that the *Robot* sheds the stray *Pixel*, leaving it behind on the *Playing Field Floor* while the *Robot* continues on its way to the *Backstage*. In this example, the stray *Pixel* was *Plowed* (i.e, it was not moved into a location that gave the *Alliance* a strategic advantage). Therefore, rule GS05.a is not violated.

If there is still uncertainty about how *Controlling*, *Possessing*, *Herding*, and *Plowing* apply to rule GS05, the Head Referee at your next competition will be happy to answer your questions during the *Drivers Meeting.* Demonstrating gameplay scenarios on a *Playing Field* is an excellent way to gain understanding of how to apply rules to complex scenarios.

**Pro Tip:** *Drive Teams* have an obligation while driving their *Robots* around the *Playing Field* to avoid *Controlling* stray *Pixels* that would cause the *Robot* to violate rule GS05. In other words, *Robots* should maneuver around stray *Pixels* if their *Herding* would cause the *Robot* to exceed the allowed number of *Controlled Pixels*.

**Warning:** Deliberately placing *Pixels* in locations on the *Playing Field Floor* to use rule GS05.a constraints as a strategy to increase the difficulty for an opposing *Alliance Robot* to move around the *Playing Field* violates rule G29.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">58</span> Rule G05 clarification</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question"><G05> Robots or Scoring Elements that are eligible for two or more Scoring achievements earn points only for the highest value achievement. Q1: Is a Yellow Pixel placed On an Alliance’s designated Backdrop location eligible for both the 20 point randomization task and the 5 point placement task? Q2: Will the Yellow Pixel then earn 3 points at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period? Q3: Are there other scenarios where rule G05 would apply (except Drones In multiple Landing Zones and Navigating)?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: The short answer is Yes. 

The yellow *Pixel* is in two *Scoring Areas*, *On* the *Backdrop* and *In* the *Backstage*. Applying rule G05, the *Pixel's* highest value achievement is for being *On* the *Backdrop*. During the *Autonomous Period*, all *Pixels* *On* the *Backdrop* earn five (5) points. The yellow *Pixel* has an additional *Randomization Task* scoring potential that is dependent upon its location *On* the *Backdrop* as described in section 4.4.2 item 2.b. The yellow *Pixel* may earn both the standard five (5) points for being *On* the *Backdrop* and the *Randomization Task* points for being in the location corresponding to the designated *Spike Mark*.

A2: Yes, if the yellow *Pixel* is *On* the *Backdrop* at the end of the *Match*.

A3: For the CENTERSTAGE game, rule G05 applies to: a) *Pixels* that are *On* the *Backdrop* and *In* the *Backstage*; b) *Robots* that are *Suspended* from the *Rigging* and are *Parked In* the *Backstage*; and c) *Drones In* two (2) *Landing Zones*.

Applying rule G05 to the *Navigation* scoring achievement during the *Autonomous Period* is not necessary because there is only one location based *Scoring Area* for the *Robot* during that *Match Period*.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In the third part of Q13 and in <GS05>c.ii of the game manual, it is mentioned that it is a penalty to move a stack of more than 2 white pixels off the line. My question is how many penalties would this violation cause? Would it cause multiple minor penalties for each pixel more than 2 on the stack, (Ex. 3 penalties for moving a stack of 5), or just one minor penalty for the entire stack moving?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Rule GS05.a is restated here with the answer to your question highlighted with bold formatting: "*Robots* may *Control* or *Possess* a maximum of two (2) *Pixels* and one (1) *Drone* at a time. *Controlling* or *Possessing* more than the allowed quantity of *Scoring Elements* is an immediate *Minor Penalty* **for each *Scoring Element* above the limit** plus an additional *Minor Penalty* per *Scoring Element* in excess of the limit for each 5-second interval that the situation continues."

If the *Robot* does not *Control* any *Pixels* just before it moves the *Pixel* stack *Off* the white tape line, the number of *Minor Penalties* is the quantity of *Pixels* in the stack minus two (2).  For example, if there are five (5) *Pixels* in the stack, the *Penalty* is three (3) *Minor Penalties* for *Controlling* three (3) *Pixels* above the allowed quantity of two (2). If the *Robot* continues to *Control* more than the allowed quantity of *Pixels*, an additional *Minor Penalty* for each *Pixel* over the allowed quantity of two (2) will be assessed every five (5) seconds that the *Robot* *Controls* more than two (2) *Pixels*.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">65</span> GS11.g.i - Tall robots being hit by opposing alliance drone near the audience side wall</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Rule GS11>g.i states - "Affecting the flight of an opposing Alliances Drone above Playing Field Wall.... Opposing Alliance Drone receives points for Landing Zone 1."
Scenario: A tall RED robot parks itself right along the audience side perimeter wall, during the game play. A BLUE drone hits it during end game and falls into the playing field instead of landing/falling into zone 1/2/3. RED team had no way of knowing the BLUE drone trajectory. Is this scenario a violation of <GS11>g.i?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Yes, the red *Alliance Robot* in this scenario violates rule GS11.g.i.

When a *Drone* contacts an opposing *Alliance Robot* that is actively playing the game in the front half (audience side) of the *Playing Field*, the referee may use their judgement to decide if it was allowed gameplay or if a rule GS11.g.i violation *Warning* or *Penalty*  should be applied.

In the scenario described in the question, the *Parked Robot* is not actively playing the game and is likely to be viewed by the referee as   a strategy to interfere with a *Drone's* flightpath.

The following are a few examples of active gameplay that are unlikely to be viewed as violating rule GS11.g.i if the *Robot* contacts an opposing *Alliance Drone*.

a) A *Robot* driving from their *Alliance's Wing* along an approximate direct path through the *Truss* or *Stage Door* towards their *Backstage* area.

b) A *Robot* returning from their *Backstage* area along an approximate direct path through the *Truss* or *Stage Door* towards their *Alliance's Wing*.

c) A *Robot* preparing to *Suspend*.

d) A *Suspended Robot*.

Example scenarios where the referee is likely to issue a rule GS11.g.i *Warning* or *Penalty* are:

e) A *Robot* moving around the front half (audience size) of the *Playing Field* without an obvious *Scoring Element* collection, transportation, or *Scoring* purpose.

f) A *Robot Parked* in the front half (audience) side of the *Playing Field*.

**Note:** *Robots* have an obligation during the *End Game* to avoid gameplay strategies that interfere with an opposing *Alliance Drone's* trajectory. Similarly, a *Robot Launching* a *Drone* may not use rule GS11.g protections as a strategy to receive *Landing Zone 1* points.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">70</span> Drone Curved Glide Path</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q1: The answer to Q30 may imply that only straight drone flights are permitted, what if a drone is meant to follow a curved glide path?

Q2: Is it right to assume that the drone cannot exceed a 12' wide x 18' long x 5' high space flight space?

Q3: If following a curved trajectory, may a drone leave the field space before returning to the Landing Zone?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: In general, a curved glide path is allowed.

A2: The Game Manual does not specify a lateral (wide) trajectory constraint. The geometry of the gameplay area is the practical limitation for the *Drone* trajectory. The eighteen (18) ft. long and five (5) ft. high *Drone* trajectory limits described in rule RG07 will be enforced.

A3: A *Drone* is allowed to exit the *Playing Field* in any direction. There are consequences if the *Drone* impacts something *Outside* the *Playing Field Wall* as described in rules GS11.g.iii, GS11.g.iv, GS11.g.v., and S1 if there is a safety hazard.

**Note 1:** *Drone* trajectory strategies that exit the *Playing Field Perimeter* other than through the audience edge of the *Playing Field Wall* do so at their own risk. 

**Note 2:** A *Drone* impacting a *Drive Team* member of either *Alliance* in a manner that is not interference (i.e., the *Drive Team* member was not able to avoid being hit) should be treated as a *Scoring Element* out of bounds and returned to the owning *Alliance's Pixel Storage* at the earliest, safe opportunity.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">71</span> REV grounding strap wiring constraints?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Reading RE14.k, it seems that the only legal connection points for a REV Grounding Strap are the female XT30 ports of a Control Hub, Expansion Hub, XT30 Power Distribution Block, or the female XT30 on a REV PowerPole to XT30 adapter. Q1: Is this an accurate conclusion? Q2: Does the "No other...adapters are permitted" portion of RE14.k also apply to electrical connections "upstream" (towards the Main Power Switch) of the CH/EH/PDB/PP component the grounding strap is connected to?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Answer 1: RE14k requires that the REV Grounding Strap be directly connected to a fully-COTS component with XT30 connectors (includes the REV provided XT30/Powerpole adapter).  It may not be connected to team manufactured wiring.

Answer 2: No. Teams are allowed to wire their robot as needed as long as the wiring does not violate any of the provisions of RE14.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">In general, it is not possible for us to rule on the legality of every possible servo.
As long as the servo meets the criteria in RE10 it is legal.

We thought it important to add a few cautions for teams exploring large servos:
- watch your total power budget. the main robot battery is fused at 20A
- the servo power module is over-current limited at 15A
- pay attention to the stall current.  the above servo has a 8.5A stall current - a significant percentage of total robot power and of servo power module capacity
- plan for variances in the stated stall currents for servos - a plus/minus 10% variance is likely 
- sustained high-current draw can cause the battery to "brown out", with the voltage dropping. large drops can cause loss of connectivity and reboots of control/expansion hubs</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q18, A1 specified that after the 0:00 buzzer, the suspended robots may descend from the rigging without losing the bonus points. The flowchart in Section 4.4.7 of GM2 indicates that pressing stop on the Driver Station is the last action in Driver-Controlled Period. Pressing stop on the robot should depower motors used for hanging which will allow some robots to descend unpowered. Does such unpowered movement negate the ‘at rest’ condition for scoring purposes?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading the description of the Robot location tasks in Game Manual Part 2 section 4.4.4 End Game.

Per section 4.4.4 in Game Manual Part 2, the *Robot* location (*Suspended* and *Parked*) *End Game Scoring* achievements are *Scored at the End of the Period*.

*Scored at the End of the Period* is defined in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 as: "The achievement’s *Scoring* status is determined based on the *Robot* or *Scoring Element’s* position at the *End of the Period* (*Autonomous* or *Driver-Controlled*)". The *End of the Period* for the *Driver-Controlled Period* occurs when the scoring system *Match* timer reaches zero seconds (0:00) remaining in the *Match*. The condition "at rest" is intentionally omitted from the definition of *End of Period Scoring*. 

The Game Design Committee (GDC) selected *End of Period Scoring* for the *End Game Robot* location *Scoring* achievements for the reason stated in the question. After the required action of pressing the stop button on the *Driver Station*, *Robots* without a mechanical lock to maintain their position, are likely to lower to the *Playing Field Floor*. The GDC wants *Suspended Robots* at the *End of the Period* to earn the *Suspended from the Rigging* points, even if the *Robot* lowers and touches the *Playing Field Floor* after the *Match* ends and the *Driver Station* stop button is pressed.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">98</span> Using Motorola phone as a camera sensor with a Control Hub</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Are we allowed to use a Motorola phone as a camera sensor connected to a Rev Robotics Control Hub in order to have a video processing stream as opposed to a frame by frame processing stream.  We do not want to use the FTC app on the phone as a secondary control hub.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The short answer is no.

This type of phone usage would need to fit into either a Vision Sensor model or a Vision Camera model.

RE11.a requires that sensors (including vision sensors) be connected only to I2C, digital I/O, encoder, or analog ports of the REV control or expansion hubs. A USB port is not a valid connection for a sensor. The usage is therefore not a Vision Sensor usage

RE16 disallows additional electronics.  Using a phone in the above described fashion is creating a user-programmable device and falls under the guidance of RE16. Vision Cameras cannot be user-programmable devices.</span>

What is the rule basis for the answer? <GS04> says "A Minor Penalty will be assessed for each Pixel that is descored.", which in the given example is only 2 pixels.

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Descoring is a change of state of a *Scoring Element* that reduces an *Alliance’s* total *Score*. Removing or repositioning a *Pixel On* the opposing *Alliance’s Backstage* has three potential descoring impacts on the *Score* (*On* the *Backdrop*, *Mosaic*, and *Set Line Bonus*). Per !Q88, a *Minor Penalty* is assessed for each descoring impact on the *Score*.

**Note:** Applying separate *Minor Penalties* for each affected *Scoring* achievement properly compensates the *Alliance* for the descoring impact on their total *Score*.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q1: If a robot during the autonomous period rams the wall in a way that knocks over multiple pixel stacks (on both red and blue sides of the field). Would this be deemed a violation of GS03?

Q2: If a robot did this same action but only was able to knock over its own three stacks on its side of the field, would this be disallowed?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: For this *Autonomous Period* gameplay scenario, the consequences are dependent upon the location of the knocked over *Pixel Stack* as described below:

*Alliance’s* half of the *Playing Field*: There are no rule GS03 consequences. *Robots* are allowed to knock over *Pixel Stacks* on their *Alliance’s* side of the *Playing Field*, provided that all of the *Pixels* remain on the owning *Alliance’s* half of the *Playing Field*. *Pixels* relocated to the opposing *Alliance’s* half of the *Playing Field* are treated as described below if the *Pixels* impact an opposing *Alliance’s Robot*.

Opposing *Alliance’s* half of the *Playing Field*: Rule GS03.c is violated if knocking over or moving the *Pixels* impacts or impedes the opposing *Alliance’s Autonomous Period Scoring* actions. Per rule GS03.c, a *Major Penalty* will be applied for each impacted *Scoring* action by an opposing *Alliance Robot*. There are many possible opposing *Alliance Robot Scoring* actions that are protected by rule GS03.c. One example scenario is a *Major Penalty* is assessed for each cycle of an opposing *Alliance Robot*: a) driving up to a pre-set *Pixel Stack* location (i.e. on the white tape adjacent to the *Playing Field Wall*) to pick up a *Pixel*, and then b) moving away to continue playing the game. 

A2: See A1.

**Warning:** The referee will likely have a conversation with the *Drive Team* about this gameplay scenario. *Robot* impact with the *Playing Field Wall* that knocks over a *Pixel Stack* is likely to be viewed as violating rule S01 for unsafe *Robot* operation.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading the the definition of "*In*" found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2.

The definition of "*In*" in section 4.3 is:  "An object that has crossed into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right angle to the *Playing Field Floor*) of a defined *Area’s* boundary is *Inside* the *Area*. An object that is entirely within the upwards vertical extension of a defined *Area’s* boundary is *Completely Inside* the *Area*. The boundary element (tape, wall, markings, etc.) is part of the *Area* for the purposes of determining *Inside* and *Outside*, unless otherwise specified."

The *Autonomous Navigation* task requirements are satisfied if the *Robot* is *Parked* (i.e., motionless) and any portion of the *Robot* has crossed into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right angle to the *Playing Field Floor*) of the *Backstage* taped boundary.

**Pro Tip:** The scoring referee has a short period of time between the end of the *Autonomous Period* and the start of the *Driver-Controlled Period* to record all of the *Autonomous Period Scoring* tasks. *Teams* can help the scoring referee accurately record an *Alliance's* scoring tasks by designing their *Autonomous* software so that their *Robot* is unambiguously *In* the *Backstage* at the end of the period.</span>

Thank you for asking about Battery Pack limitations. COTS USB Battery Packs are limited to a capacity of 27,000mAh or less. This is also the standard [TSA limit](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries) for taking Lithium-containing COTS USB Battery Packs (with 3.7V cells) onto aircraft in the USA.

COTS USB Battery Packs that adhere to the USB-PD or USB-QC specification may be used to provide a 12V source as described. Please ensure that the COTS USB External Battery is in no way connected to the robot's power system.

When using COTS USB External Battery Packs for legal LED and related uses, please observe a heightened level of vigilence in their safe use. The [Robot Controller Power Distribution page](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/control_hard_compon/rc_components/power_distr/power-distr.html) on ftc-docs has been updated with proper guidance for [using COTS USB External Battery Packs](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/control_hard_compon/rc_components/power_distr/power-distr.html#cots-usb-battery-pack).

	<span name="question">Q57 makes it clear that pixels on the backdrop do not count toward the possession limit. If a robot is holding two pixels, will it incur possession penalties by removing a pixel from the backdrop (therefore no longer being supported by the backdrop) and placing it back on the backdrop?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reviewing the *Robot Control/Possession* limits for *Scoring Elements* rule (GS05). 

After removing the *Pixel* from the *Backdrop*, the *Robot* in this scenario is no longer protected by rule GS05.c.v and is therefore *Possessing* three (3) *Pixels*, one (1) more than the maximum allowed number of *Pixels* per rule GS05.a. The *Robot/Alliance* should receive an immediate *Minor Penalty* for *Possessing* one  *Pixel* over the allowed limit of two (2) *Pixels*. An additional *Minor Penalty* for the excess *Possessed Pixel* should be assessed for each 5-second interval that the *Robot* continues to *Possesses* three (3) *Pixels*.

If the *Robot* *Scores* a *Pixel* on the *Backdrop* or in the *Backstage* while *Possessing* three (3) *Pixels*, the *Robot/Alliance* will receive an additional *Minor Penalty* per rule GS05.b.</span>

Q2: May the drive team coach move around the Alliance Station to be closer to the human player and then return to their drive team?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Yes, *Drive Team* members may use signaling aids that satisfy the restrictions listed below. 

!Q111 provides the *Human Player* with guidance for using signaling aids. *Drive Team* members in an *Alliance Station* may also use signaling aids with additional restrictions to address safety and interference issues that arise from six (6) people occupying a confined space. Guidance for the *Human Player* is less restrictive due to the isolated, single occupant *Human Player Station*.

*Drive Team* members may use signaling aids when abiding by the following restrictions:

1) The signaling aids are not a safety hazard. For example, placing a signaling aid on the floor is a tripping hazard.

2) Small hand-held signaling aids, including white boards and pre-printed signs, are allowed.

3) The signaling aid may not be intentionally dropped or placed on the floor.

4) If the signaling aid is accidentally dropped, it will not harm the venue floor. 

5) The signaling aid and *Drive Team* member do not distract an opposing *Alliance Drive Team* per rule G16.c.

6) The *Drive Team* member doesn't reach *Into* the *Playing Field* per rule GS12.h.

7) The signaling aid doesn't use electronics of any type per rule G11.

8) Dropped or placed signaling aid(s) into the *Playing Field* are subject to rule G22.

A2: Yes, provided that the *Drive Team* member remains *In* their *Alliance Station* per rules G16 and G16a, and does not distract nor interfere with the opposing *Alliance’s Human Player* or *Drive Team* per rule G16.c.</span>

If our robot is too large before initialization, can our initialization routine power motors to make the robot fit?

A2: No, stalling a DC motor for an extended period of time such as Pre-*Match* set up and inspection risks damaging the motor (most motors rely on spinning to ensure proper cooling) and consumes a significant amount stored energy from the *Robot's* main battery. More importantly, stalled motors can create smoke and noxious gases as well as generate extreme heat within the motor that can lead to fire (depending on the motor and materials surrounding the motor).</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">We wanted to confirm that the answer to 2) is a change from last year’s response, which said stalling was allowed. For clarification, we wanted to pose another case: during initialization (both during inspection & pre-game) could we have the motors that power our lift move so that the lift is raised to a specific height? In this instance, the motor is not stalling: it is running to a position and then holding that position, the same way a servo holds its position while the robot is initialized.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Motors and servos "hold position" very differently. Motors with a load applied to their motor shaft can "hold position" through mechanical friction (via a gearbox/gear train) or through stalling. Servos with a load applied to their splines generally only "hold position" through stalling. If the motor can "hold position" even when power is no longer being applied to the motor, then that is legal. If power must be applied to the motor to hold position, it's not legal.</span>

Does the Landing Zone have to be a flat ground or could we erect nets that are placed with PVC pipe at the correct distances. For instance, at 24" there would be a net with the top level with the field. This would allow the Drone to hit it and fall down in the correct zone. Or is it required we build an extension to the stage for the landing zone?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The use of nets, either vertically or horizontally placed, would go against the intent of the challenge. 
1. Vertical nets would trap/capture drones inside a landing zone.
2. Horizontal nets allow the drones to be "caught" in the net.

An option would be to look over the venue layout and decide if the stage is the best option for the field, or if there may be a better space within the venue to accommodate the landing zones without the need to build an extension. If not, an extension off the stage may be built to accommodate the landing zones. We recommend placing field personnel (not referees) near the locations where stage and the extension zone meet so that no one walks on the extension. Stanchions or another deterrent from the audience approaching the landing zones should be a consideration to ensure audience members are not accidentally hit with launched drones.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">146</span> REV Blinkin firmware update and/or customization</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">REV has instructions for updating the firmware in the Blinkin LED Driver, including how to modify the firmware to create custom light patterns.   https://github.com/REVrobotics/Blinkin-Firmware
Q1: Could custom firmware following the "Creating a custom function" instructions solely for producing custom light patterns to indicate the color of pixels held in the robot be legal? 
Q2: If no, would it still be legal to follow REV's instructions to update the OEM firmware without modification?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer to both questions is no.

Updating the REV Blinkin firmware in the described manner would violate RE15 - for allowed modifications as well as RE16 as the system would now effectively be equivalent to a generic programmable device (i.e. arduino, raspberry pi, etc.)</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">147</span> Robots peeling tape off playing field tiles</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Some robots have been peeling tape off the field, such as those that include ramps to "scoop" pixels off the field. Q1: Would a team be penalized for peeling tape off the field, either partially or entirely? Q2: If yes, what is the penalty? Would it mean the part itself is illegal (violates <RG01>a), or the action of peeling the tape is illegal (violates <S01>)? Q3: For example, would a soft ramp that slides along the floor be legal, provided it never peels off tape or causes any other damage?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Yes, rule S01 is violated if the damage is significant enough to require *Match* delaying repair.

A2: The consequences of violating rule S01 are described in section 4.5.1 of Game Manual Part 2: "If at any time the *Robot* operation is deemed unsafe or has damaged the *Playing Field* or another *Robot*, by the determination of the referees, the offending *Robot* may be *Disabled*, and the *Team* may be issued a *Yellow Card*. Re-inspection of the *Robot* is required before it may play another *Match*. Damage that requires significant repair and/or delays subsequent *Match* play is likely to escalate to a *Red Card*."

A3: Ramps are not inherently illegal *Robot* parts; how the ramp is used in gameplay determines its illegality unless the ramp is identified as having obviously unsafe characteristics during *Robot* inspection.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">RE13.b.ii specifies that Vision Cameras can connect to REV Control Hub (Robot Controller) using a "powered USB hub", but doesn't mention allowed power sources for the USB hub. RE14.c.ii mentions energy sources for a powered USB hub, but RE14 also says "smartphone" robot controller device and RE14.c.ii refers only to connecting the hub to an Expansion Hub USB. Thus RE14 perhaps excludes the Control Hub USB. Q: Can a USB hub connected to a Control Hub be powered by sources listed in RE14.c.ii?</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">202</span> Fiducial Legality under RM06c</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In GM1 RM06c, fiducial images of any type are disallowed for Robot construction. In Q192 and Q197, patterns, logos, and images of any type are interpreted as fiducial and disallowed under TE03 because of this. 

a) Does RM06c use the same definition of "fiducial", and thus prohibit use of patterns (such as patterned pocketing) and team/sponsor logos on team robots? 

b) Does RM06c concern any fiducial markings on COTS parts? A specific example would be the barcodes on Andymark NeveRest Motors.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answers to Q192 and 197 have been updated as follows.  If this does not answer your question please re-submit.

Based on the feedback we have received from Teams and volunteers we are clarifying and relaxing the restrictions on the types of images that are allowed on the Team Prop. The intent of rule TE03b is:
1.	prevent the use of any object on the field that could confuse or distract other Robots.
2.	prevent the use of canned solutions to simplify the task of object identification.

Therefore, any image that resembles a QR code, AprilTag, or coded vision target is not allowed.  All other images such as team logos, sponsor logos, raised areas, cut outs, etc. are allowed, providing no other rule is violated. 

 Fiducials as part of a COTS label are allowed.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">203</span> Pipe height minimum</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The game manual 2 C-6 Truss and Rigging (pdf page 36) shows the fixed yellow pipe height to be "~14", allowing some height variation. But how much?  1/8"? 1/4"? 1"? 3"? Can FIRST provide a required minimum height so teams can be sure their robots will travel under the fixed pipe?  This is especially important at tournaments where field inspection can be done before matches.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We believe that the answers you are looking for can be found by reading and understanding G08 and the explanatory orange box below it in Game Manual Part 2.

The specification for the yellow bar height is approximately 14".  Applying the tolerances would suggest that a team should expect possible variations in the height of the yellow bars.  Teams should take into account the risks that come with not paying attention to these potential variations.

As is mentioned in the orange box, events strive to setup and maintain a much more accurate setup/placement of their fields and game elements, but teams should take the tolerances into consideration when designing and building their robots.</span>

The formal definition of height is:  the distance from the bottom to the top of something, the distance upward from a given level to a fixed point, or something measured vertically.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">229</span> Servo current limit on REV control hub</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The inspection checklist states that servos must not exceed the manufacturer specs for the controller <RE11>. The REV control hub has a 2 amp limit per servo port pair (https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/control-system-overview/control-hub-basics). Commonly used GoBilda servos have a stall current of 2 amps at 4.8V and 2.5 amps at 6V. So the GoBilda servo could use slightly more than 2 amps at 5V (REV hub output). Does that mean a GoBilda servo cannot be directly connected to the REV hub?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Servos are allowed to be directly connected to the REV Hubs (Control and Expansion) as long as the Voltage range of the servo is compatible with the hub (see RE10). Current draw is not a factor for compatibility, only for performance.
