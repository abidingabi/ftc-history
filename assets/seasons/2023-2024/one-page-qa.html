	<h2>Q<span name="number">1</span> Drones and backdrop</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">When having a discussion of the rules about the 
backdrop and drones. Several students questioned what would happen if a 
drone went back and hit the backdrop and knocked down pixels of the 
opposite alliance. Would there be a penalty for the drone hitting the 
backdrop.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The *Pixel* descoring rule, GS04, applies to this 
gameplay scenario. A *Minor Penalty* will be assessed for each *Pixel* 
descored from the opposing *Alliance's Backdrop*.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">2</span> Spitting out a third pixel</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Per rule <gs05> robots can’t possess/control more
 than 2 pixels, and doing so results in a minor penalty for each 
additional pixel as well as another minor penalty after every 5 seconds.

Q1: We were wondering if there is an exception to be made for intaking a
 3rd pixel and immediately spitting it back out.

Q2: Additionally, if such an exception is the case, are there 
limitations on our actions while the 3rd pixel is in our 
possession/control? (ex. driving)</gs05></span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Yes there is an exception. The *Robot* in this 
scenario is unlikely to be *Penalized* for *Controlling* too many 
*Pixels*. The referee should view the *Robot's* actions as being both 
*Inadvertent* and *Inconsequential* and not call a rule GS05 *Penalty* 
as allowed by rule G10.

A2: Yes, for this scenario, there are limitations to being excused for a
 rule GS05 *Penalty*. The *Robot* is unlikely to receive a rule GS05 
*Penalty* if the *Robot* satisfies the following two conditions: 1) It 
ejects the extra *Pixel* in a reasonable amount of time and; 2) It 
refrains from playing the game while *Controlling* the extra *Pixel*. 
Two examples of playing the game are: a) Traveling to a different 
location and; b) Placing a *Pixel In* a *Scoring Area*. If the *Robot's*
 actions are clearly focused on removing the extra *Pixel* and not 
playing other aspects of the game, it is highly unlikely that it will 
receive a GS05 *Penalty".</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The intent of Rule GS05.c.(i&amp;ii) is to allow 
reasonable *Robot* interaction with a *Pixel* stack without violating 
the *Pixel Control/Possession* limits described in rule GS05.a. The Rule
 GS05.c.i exception is for *Pixel(s)* knocked off of a stack and onto 
the *Playing Field Floor*. The Rule GS05c.ii exception is for the 
movement of three (3) or more of the pre-set stacked *Pixels* as a group
 that stay *On* the white tape line.

A1: Penalizing the movement of the *Pixel* stack applies when three (3) 
or more stacked *Pixels* are moved all together *Off* of the white tape 
line. Moving a "single *Pixel* from the stack past the tape edge" is 
allowed because it is less than the two (2) *Pixel 
Controller/Possession* limit described in rule GS05.a.

A2: Yes, the rule GS05.c.i exemption applies to any number of *Pixels* 
knocked off of the stack onto the *Playing Field Floor*. The knocked off
 *Pixels* are not subject to rule GS05.a constraints, even if they come 
to rest *Off* of the white tape line.

**Bonus Information:** *Pixels* in the pre-set stacks can't be 
*Propelled* per rule GS10.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">13</span> GS05 - Robot Control/Possession Limits for Pixels</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Please explain if these scenarios will be penalized:
Q1: Robot knocks a pixel stack down (GS05.c.i). These pixels are such that they are no longer stacked and are scattered singles.
Q2: Robot pushes 3/4/5 of the knocked down pixels into the backstage (GS05.c.iii).
Q3: The restriction seems to be, a robot can not move a stack of 3 or more pixels from the white line.
Q4: Scattered / knocked off pixels can be plowed. Is that accurate?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: No *Penalty*. Rule GS05.c.i allows a *Robot* to
 knock over a stack of unscored *Pixels*.

A2: The *Robot* will be penalized for violating rule GS05.a because it 
is *Controlling* more than two (2) *Pixels*. The *Pixels* in this 
scenario are *Herded*, a form of *Control*, by the *Robot* because the 
*Pixels* are pushed to a desired location that gains a strategic 
advantage beyond the *Robot* moving around the *Playing Field*. The 
*Pixels* in this scenario do not qualify for the rule GS05.c.iii 
exception for *Plowing*. See the definitions of "*Herding*" and 
"*Plowing*" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 to fully understand the
 difference between these game-specific terms. 

A3: Correct, a *Robot* will be penalized for moving a stack of three (3)
 or more *Pixels Off* of the white tape line per rules GS05.a and 
GS05c.ii.

A4: Yes, any quantity of "scattered/knocked off *Pixels*" can be

	<h2>Q<span name="number">14</span> Launching Pixels</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Launching is defined as "Propelling Game Elements
 through the air or water above the Playing Field Floor." 

Q1: Are Pixels considered launched if they stay in contact with the 
floor? 

Q2: In other words, can be slid along the floor and not be considered 
Launched and if so, are there any constraints in how far they can go?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">An understanding of the game-specific defined terms
 "*Propel/Propelling*", "*Launch/Launching*", and "*Slide/Sliding*" 
found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 is necessary to fully 
understand Q1, Q2, and their answers. Please take a moment to review 
these definitions before proceeding. 

The "bonus information" following answers A1 and A2 addresses a related 
gameplay scenario that complements Q1 and Q2.

A1: No, a *Pixel* that is "in contact with the floor" does not satisfy 
the definition of "*Launched*" in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2.

A2: A *Pixel* "slid along the floor" does not satisfy the definition of 
"*Launched*" because the *Pixel* remains in contact with the "Playing 
Field Floor".

**Bonus Information:** Rule GS10 states that *Pixels* may not be 
*Propelled*. Each violation of this rule results in a *Minor Penalty*. 
To understand how to apply rule GS10 to *Pixels* that are *Slid* by a 
*Robot*, we need to review the definitions of "*Sliding*" and 
"*Propelling*".

"*Sliding*" is defined as *Propelling Game Elements* along the *Playing 
Field Floor*. 

"*Propelling*" is giving *Game Elements* enough force such that they 
move independent of contact with the *Robot* or *Human Player*. 
*Launching*, *Rolling*, and *Sliding* are forms of *Propelling*. 

Since "*Sliding*" is a form of "*Propelling*", a *Robot* causing a 
*Pixel* to *Slide* violates rule GS10.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">16</span> Drone Launching</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">How is "over" defined for the purpose of 
&lt;4.4.4.2&gt; "Launched Drones must pass over the Truss and/or Stage 
Door for each scoring attempt to earn points."

Specifically, does the drone need to be fully clear of touching its 
launching robot before the leading edge of the drone passes the plane 
over the Rigging or before the trailing edge leaves the plane above the 
Rigging?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A *Robot* must release  the *Drone* (i.e, no 
*Drone* contact with the *Robot*) before any part of the *Drone* passes 
over the *Rigging* or top pole of the *Stage Door*.

The following text demonstrates how to use the Game Manual to 
substantiate the answer.

The answer to the question is found by applying the game-specific 
definitions of "*Launch/Launching*" and "*Propel/Propelling*" found in 
section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2 to rule GS11.e.

Rule GS11.e states that "for each scoring attempt (*Launch*, fly, land),
 a *Launched Drone* must pass over a *Rigging* or top pole of the *Stage
 Door* before it is eligible to *Score* points. The key point is that 
the *Drone* must be *Launched* before passing over the specified *Game 
Elements*. Next, we need to understand and apply the definition of 
"*Launch*."

"*Launch/Launching*" is defined as *Propelling Game Elements* through 
the air or water above the *Playing Field Floor*. Okay, now we need to 
review the definition of "*Propelling*."

"*Propel/Propelling*" is defined as giving *Game Elements* enough force 
such that they move independent of contact with the *Robot* or *Human 
Player*.

Therefore, a "*Launched*" *Drone* is no longer touching the *Robot*.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answers that you seek are found by reading the 
description of the *Robot* location tasks in Game Manual Part 2 section 
4.4.4 *End Game*.

A1: Yes, to earn 20 points for being *Suspended from the Rigging*, a 
*Robot* must be *Suspended* from the *Rigging* when the scoring system 
*Match* timer reaches zero seconds (0:00) remaining in the *Match* or at
 some point during the end of *Match* sound played by the scoring 
system. After the *Match* ends, the *Robot* may remain *Suspended* or 
lower to the *Playing Field Floor* without affecting the previously 
earned 20 points for completing the *Suspended from the Rigging* 
achievement.

A2: No, a *Robot* located on the *Playing Field Floor* at the end of the
 *Match* (i.e., match time equals 0:00) does not satisfy the requirement
 of being *Suspended* by the *Rigging* at the *End of the Period*. 
However, there is still time to complete the scoring achievement; the 
*Robot Suspension* task may still occur, provided that the *Robot* is 
*Suspended* by the conclusion of the end of *Match* sound played by the 
scoring system.

**Note:** A1 and A2 were updated on November 6, 2023 to recognize that 
the end of *Match* buzzer length is a "grace period" for accomplishing 
the *Suspension* task.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">If the *Drone* has passed inspection and it remains
 in a legal configuration (rule GS11.f) throughout the *Match*, a 
gameplay penalty is not assessed if it flies with a "near ballistic

A referee may require the *Drone* to be reinspected before it is used in
 a subsequent *Match* if there is concern that it violates a 
construction rule.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">31</span> Are there any solutions/future plans to ensure metal field elements are grounded?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The middle metal poles holding the truss, 
rigging, and stage door seem to have no way of electrically grounding 
themselves to outside of the field, so when metal on the robot touches 
these elements, there is a static discharge that cannot be avoided by 
teams. <rg01> i) states robots cannot ground themselves to the playing 
field, and a grounding strap doesn't help. Will there be any rules that 
ensure competition fields are set up to remove static build-up on these 
poles?</rg01></span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">This may come as a shock (pun intended), but 
grounding the field may have the opposite effect that you intend. By 
grounding certain elements of the field you virtually guarantee that ESD
 shocks will be more intense and more frequent, as there will almost 
always be a large difference in potential between any floating object 
sliding/moving on the field (robot, game pieces, etc...) and the 
grounded elements. Understand also that the common wisdom of “touching 
metal” also doesn’t apply the same as it may have 5-6 years ago either -
 realize that virtually all aluminum extrusion on robots today is 
anodized, which is an electrically non-conducting coating on the 
extrusion. Older Tetrix anodized aluminum seems to have a thinner 
anodized layer, so it wears/scratches/rubs off more easily, and thus it 
was more likely that the aluminum would be electrically conductive and 
charge-accessible. This means you're not able to consistently rely on 
"metal" to "electrically connect" areas around the robot (i.e. thinking 
of the frame as a “wire” isn’t as applicable). Also the grounding strap 
is not meant to "ground" your robot, it's meant to attempt to equalize 
the potential between your electronics and areas of static build-up on 
the robot that the strap is connected to so that when ESD does happen 
the charge potential is hopefully small and thus has little to no 
effect. The [Managing 
ESD](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/
hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-
esd.html) article on ftc-docs has several recommendations for how teams 
can protect their robots. No one solution is a silver bullet, though, 
careful attention is key!

You’ve asked about what event organizers are doing to reduce ESD buildup
 on the fields. Heavy Duty Staticide is a staple for treating fields, 
especially those that are at high risk for static charge buildup like 
areas with extremely low humidity. This Heavy Duty Staticide has been 
proven to be extremely effective at significantly reducing (or 
eliminating) static charge buildup.</span>

That way we have two yellow pixels on the backdrop by end of autonomous.
Q3: Is there any way an alliance can put more colored pixels on the 
backdrop during the autonomous period?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Yes, see section 4.4.1 item 3.d in Game Manual 
Part 2 for how to place a *Team Prop* on the *Playing Field* during 
pre-*Match* set up.

A2: Yes.

A3: Each *Drive Team* may *Pre-Load* exactly one (1) yellow *Pixel* and 
one (1) purple *Pixel* during pre-*Match* set up as described in section
 4.4.1 item 3.b in Game Manual Part 2. This is the only way non-white 
colored *Pixels* enter the *Playing Field* for use during the 
*Autonomous Period*. 

A highly unlikely, legal way for a *Robot* to access an additional 
non-white *Pixel* would be by picking up a stray non-white *Pixel* 
located *In* its *Alliance's* half of the *Playing Field*. Keep in mind 
that *Robots* may only use its own *Pre-Loaded Pixels* to earn 
*Randomization Task* points per  section 4.4.2 item 2.b in Game Manual 
Part 2.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">50</span> Followup Q13</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">I am still not clear on Q13, as well as the how 
to apply rule GS05 in the game manual part 2.

1) GS05c. iii. - Plowing through any quantity of Scoring Elements is 
allowed.

2) GS05a. - Controlling or Possessing more than the allowed quantity of 
Scoring Elements is an immediate Minor Penalty.

I am looking for one example where plowing a robot through 3/4/5 
elements does not violate rule GS05a, or does not belong to herding. I 
am unable to understand the use of GS05.c.iii.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Before proceeding with reading the following 
information, please review the game-specific definitions of the terms 
*Control*, *Possess*, *Herding*, and *Plowing* in section 4.3 of Game 
Manual Part 2. Applying the common or dictionary definitions of any 
game-specific term in section 4.3 may result in a misunderstanding of a 
scoring achievement requirement, rule, procedure, etc. Game-specific 
terms are easy to identify in the Game Manual because they have italics 
formatting and the first letter is capitalized. For example, the text 
"*Control*" has the correct formatting for a game-specific term. We 
strive to use this same formatting for defined terms contained in 
answers to gameplay questions in this forum.

Rule GS05.a limits the number of *Pixels* and *Drones* that a *Robot* 
can legally *Control* or *Possess*. This *Team's* question (!Q50) asks 
for an example of where *Plowing* through 3/4/5 *Pixels* does not 
violate rule GS05.a. The definition of *Control* specifically states 
that *Plowing* is not a form of *Control*. Therefore, all *Plowing* 
actions by a *Robot* do not violate the *Scoring Element 
Control/Possession* rule, GS05.a.

The second part of this *Team's* question asks for a *Plowing* scenario 
that is not *Herding*. Since *Plowing* actions and *Herding* actions are
 mutually exclusive, all *Plowing* actions are not *Herding*".

The following are gameplay examples that may be helpful:

Example 1: A *Robot* collects two *Pixels* from a *Pixel* stack. Since 
these are the only *Pixels Possessed* or *Controlled* by the *Robot*, 
rule GS05.a is not violated. The *Robot* drives directly through the 
*Truss* or *Stage Door* and stops *In* their *Alliance's Backstage*. 
Along the way to the *Backstage*, a stray *Pixel* on the *Playing Field 
Floor* is pushed by the *Robot* and it winds up *In* the *Backstage*. 
The *Robot* has now violated rule GS05.a because it *Possesses* two 
*Pixels* and it *Controlled* (*Herded*) the stray *Pixel* for a total of
 three (3) *Controlled Pixels*. The stray *Pixel* was *Herded* because 
it was moved to a location that provided the *Alliance* a strategic 
advantage since it was *Scored In* the *Backstage*.

Example 2: Same as Example 1, except when the *Robot* encounters the 
stray *Pixel*, it pushes the stray *Pixel* for a short distance. The 
*Drive Team* quickly realizes that the *Robot* just started to *Control*
 too many *Pixels*.  The *Drive Team* changes the *Robot's* direction of
 travel so that the *Robot* sheds the stray *Pixel*, leaving it behind 
on the *Playing Field Floor* while the *Robot* continues on its way to 
the *Backstage*. In this example, the stray *Pixel* was *Plowed* (i.e, 
it was not moved into a location that gave the *Alliance* a strategic 
advantage). Therefore, rule GS05.a is not violated.

If there is still uncertainty about how *Controlling*, *Possessing*, 
*Herding*, and *Plowing* apply to rule GS05, the Head Referee at your 
next competition will be happy to answer your questions during the 
*Drivers Meeting.* Demonstrating gameplay scenarios on a *Playing Field*
 is an excellent way to gain understanding of how to apply rules to 
complex scenarios.

**Pro Tip:** *Drive Teams* have an obligation while driving their 
*Robots* around the *Playing Field* to avoid *Controlling* stray 
*Pixels* that would cause the *Robot* to violate rule GS05. In other 
words, *Robots* should maneuver around stray *Pixels* if their *Herding*
 would cause the *Robot* to exceed the allowed number of *Controlled 
Pixels*.

**Warning:** Deliberately placing *Pixels* in locations on the *Playing 
Field Floor* to use rule GS05.a constraints as a strategy to increase 
the difficulty for an opposing *Alliance Robot* to move around the 
*Playing Field* violates rule G29.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: The short answer is Yes. 

The yellow *Pixel* is in two *Scoring Areas*, *On* the *Backdrop* and 
*In* the *Backstage*. Applying rule G05, the *Pixel's* highest value 
achievement is for being *On* the *Backdrop*. During the *Autonomous 
Period*, all *Pixels* *On* the *Backdrop* earn five (5) points. The 
yellow *Pixel* has an additional *Randomization Task* scoring potential 
that is dependent upon its location *On* the *Backdrop* as described in 
section 4.4.2 item 2.b. The yellow *Pixel* may earn both the standard 
five (5) points for being *On* the *Backdrop* and the *Randomization 
Task* points for being in the location corresponding to the designated 
*Spike Mark*.

A2: Yes, if the yellow *Pixel* is *On* the *Backdrop* at the end of the 
*Match*.

A3: For the CENTERSTAGE game, rule G05 applies to: a) *Pixels* that are 
*On* the *Backdrop* and *In* the *Backstage*; b) *Robots* that are 
*Suspended* from the *Rigging* and are *Parked In* the *Backstage*; and 
c) *Drones In* two (2) *Landing Zones*.

Applying rule G05 to the *Navigation* scoring achievement during the

	<h2>Q<span name="number">65</span> GS11.g.i - Tall robots being hit by opposing alliance drone near the audience side wall</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Rule GS11&gt;g.i states - "Affecting the flight 
of an opposing Alliances Drone above Playing Field Wall.... Opposing 
Alliance Drone receives points for Landing Zone 1."
Scenario: A tall RED robot parks itself right along the audience side 
perimeter wall, during the game play. A BLUE drone hits it during end 
game and falls into the playing field instead of landing/falling into 
zone 1/2/3. RED team had no way of knowing the BLUE drone trajectory. Is
 this scenario a violation of <gs11>g.i?</gs11></span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Yes, the red *Alliance Robot* in this scenario 
violates rule GS11.g.i.

When a *Drone* contacts an opposing *Alliance Robot* that is actively 
playing the game in the front half (audience side) of the *Playing 
Field*, the referee may use their judgement to decide if it was allowed 
gameplay or if a rule GS11.g.i violation *Warning* or *Penalty*  should 
be applied.

In the scenario described in the question, the *Parked Robot* is not 
actively playing the game and is likely to be viewed by the referee as  
 a strategy to interfere with a *Drone's* flightpath.

The following are a few examples of active gameplay that are unlikely to
 be viewed as violating rule GS11.g.i if the *Robot* contacts an 
opposing *Alliance Drone*.

a) A *Robot* driving from their *Alliance's Wing* along an approximate 
direct path through the *Truss* or *Stage Door* towards their 
*Backstage* area.

b) A *Robot* returning from their *Backstage* area along an approximate 
direct path through the *Truss* or *Stage Door* towards their 
*Alliance's Wing*.

c) A *Robot* preparing to *Suspend*.

d) A *Suspended Robot*.

Example scenarios where the referee is likely to issue a rule GS11.g.i 
*Warning* or *Penalty* are:

e) A *Robot* moving around the front half (audience size) of the 
*Playing Field* without an obvious *Scoring Element* collection, 
transportation, or *Scoring* purpose.

f) A *Robot Parked* in the front half (audience) side of the *Playing 
Field*.

**Note:** *Robots* have an obligation during the *End Game* to avoid 
gameplay strategies that interfere with an opposing *Alliance Drone's* 
trajectory. Similarly, a *Robot Launching* a *Drone* may not use rule 
GS11.g protections as a strategy to receive *Landing Zone 1* points.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q1: The answer to Q30 may imply that only 
straight drone flights are permitted, what if a drone is meant to follow
 a curved glide path?

Q2: Is it right to assume that the drone cannot exceed a 12' wide x 18' 
long x 5' high space flight space?

Q3: If following a curved trajectory, may a drone leave the field space 
before returning to the Landing Zone?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: In general, a curved glide path is allowed.

A2: The Game Manual does not specify a lateral (wide) trajectory 
constraint. The geometry of the gameplay area is the practical 
limitation for the *Drone* trajectory. The eighteen (18) ft. long and 
five (5) ft. high *Drone* trajectory limits described in rule RG07 will 
be enforced.

A3: A *Drone* is allowed to exit the *Playing Field* in any direction. 
There are consequences if the *Drone* impacts something *Outside* the 
*Playing Field Wall* as described in rules GS11.g.iii, GS11.g.iv, 
GS11.g.v., and S1 if there is a safety hazard.

**Note 1:** *Drone* trajectory strategies that exit the *Playing Field 
Perimeter* other than through the audience edge of the *Playing Field 
Wall* do so at their own risk. 

**Note 2:** A *Drone* impacting a *Drive Team* member of either 
*Alliance* in a manner that is not interference (i.e., the *Drive Team* 
member was not able to avoid being hit) should be treated as a *Scoring 
Element* out of bounds and returned to the owning *Alliance's Pixel

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">In general, it is not possible for us to rule on 
the legality of every possible servo.
As long as the servo meets the criteria in RE10 it is legal.

We thought it important to add a few cautions for teams exploring large 
servos:
- watch your total power budget. the main robot battery is fused at 20A
- the servo power module is over-current limited at 15A
- pay attention to the stall current.  the above servo has a 8.5A stall 
current - a significant percentage of total robot power and of servo 
power module capacity
- plan for variances in the stated stall currents for servos - a 
plus/minus 10% variance is likely 
- sustained high-current draw can cause the battery to "brown out", with
 the voltage dropping. large drops can cause loss of connectivity and 
reboots of control/expansion hubs</span>

 suspended robots may descend from the rigging without losing the bonus 
points. The flowchart in Section 4.4.7 of GM2 indicates that pressing 
stop on the Driver Station is the last action in Driver-Controlled 
Period. Pressing stop on the robot should depower motors used for 
hanging which will allow some robots to descend unpowered. Does such 
unpowered movement negate the ‘at rest’ condition for scoring purposes?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading the 
description of the Robot location tasks in Game Manual Part 2 section 
4.4.4 End Game.

Per section 4.4.4 in Game Manual Part 2, the *Robot* location 
(*Suspended* and *Parked*) *End Game Scoring* achievements are *Scored 
at the End of the Period*.

*Scored at the End of the Period* is defined in section 4.3 of Game 
Manual Part 2 as: "The achievement’s *Scoring* status is determined 
based on the *Robot* or *Scoring Element’s* position at the *End of the 
Period* (*Autonomous* or *Driver-Controlled*)". The *End of the Period* 
for the *Driver-Controlled Period* occurs when the scoring system 
*Match* timer reaches zero seconds (0:00) remaining in the *Match*. The 
condition "at rest" is intentionally omitted from the definition of *End
 of Period Scoring*. 

The Game Design Committee (GDC) selected *End of Period Scoring* for the
 *End Game Robot* location *Scoring* achievements for the reason stated 
in the question. After the required action of pressing the stop button 
on the *Driver Station*, *Robots* without a mechanical lock to maintain 
their position, are likely to lower to the *Playing Field Floor*. The 
GDC wants *Suspended Robots* at the *End of the Period* to earn the 
*Suspended from the Rigging* points, even if the *Robot* lowers and 
touches the *Playing Field Floor* after the *Match* ends and the *Driver
 Station* stop button is pressed.</span>

 Penalty* for each affected *Pixel*, completed *Mosaic*, and *Set 
Bonus*. For example, descoring two *Pixels* that are part of a completed
 *Mosaic* and a *Set Bonus* achievement. Receive four *Minor Penalties* 
as described below:

a) Two (2) descored *Pixels* =  Two (2) *Minor Penalties*.

b) Two (2) *Pixels* from the same *Mosaic* = One (1) *Minor Penalty*.

c) One (1) or two (2) *Pixels* eliminating one (1) *Set Line* 
achievement = One (1) *Minor Penalty*.

A2: Any direct *Robot* contact initiated by the red *Alliance Robot* 
should be penalized if *Pixels* are descored. Maneuvering close to an 
opposing *Alliance Robot* that is close to their *Alliance's Backdrop* 
and/or *Backstage* is a risky gameplay strategy that does not have an 
obvious strategic gameplay advantage other than to disrupt the opposing 
*Alliance Robot*. In the scenario described in the question, the referee
 should penalize the red *Alliance Robot* for violating the descoring 
rule GS04.</span>

This type of phone usage would need to fit into either a Vision Sensor

RE11.a requires that sensors (including vision sensors) be connected 
only to I2C, digital I/O, encoder, or analog ports of the REV control or

usage is therefore not a Vision Sensor usage

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: For this *Autonomous Period* gameplay scenario,
 the consequences are dependent upon the location of the knocked over 
*Pixel Stack* as described below:

*Alliance’s* half of the *Playing Field*: There are no rule GS03 
consequences. *Robots* are allowed to knock over *Pixel Stacks* on their
 *Alliance’s* side of the *Playing Field*, provided that all of the 
*Pixels* remain on the owning *Alliance’s* half of the *Playing Field*. 
*Pixels* relocated to the opposing *Alliance’s* half of the *Playing 
Field* are treated as described below if the *Pixels* impact an opposing
 *Alliance’s Robot*.

Opposing *Alliance’s* half of the *Playing Field*: Rule GS03.c is 
violated if knocking over or moving the *Pixels* impacts or impedes the 
opposing *Alliance’s Autonomous Period Scoring* actions. Per rule 
GS03.c, a *Major Penalty* will be applied for each impacted *Scoring* 
action by an opposing *Alliance Robot*. There are many possible opposing
 *Alliance Robot Scoring* actions that are protected by rule GS03.c. One
 example scenario is a *Major Penalty* is assessed for each cycle of an 
opposing *Alliance Robot*: a) driving up to a pre-set *Pixel Stack* 
location (i.e. on the white tape adjacent to the *Playing Field Wall*) 
to pick up a *Pixel*, and then b) moving away to continue playing the 
game. 

A2: See A1.

**Warning:** The referee will likely have a conversation with the *Drive
 Team* about this gameplay scenario. *Robot* impact with the *Playing 
Field Wall* that knocks over a *Pixel Stack* is likely to be viewed as 
violating rule S01 for unsafe *Robot* operation.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">116</span> Parking in the backstage at the end of autonomous</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">At the end of the autonomous period, the robot 
can earn 5 points for being parked in the appropriate backstage area. 
How much of the robot must be within the taped area to earn the bonus 
points?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading the 
the definition of "*In*" found in section 4.3 of Game Manual Part 2.

The definition of "*In*" in section 4.3 is:  "An object that has crossed
 into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right angle to the 
*Playing Field Floor*) of a defined *Area’s* boundary is *Inside* the 
*Area*. An object that is entirely within the upwards vertical extension
 of a defined *Area’s* boundary is *Completely Inside* the *Area*. The 
boundary element (tape, wall, markings, etc.) is part of the *Area* for 
the purposes of determining *Inside* and *Outside*, unless otherwise 
specified."

The *Autonomous Navigation* task requirements are satisfied if the 
*Robot* is *Parked* (i.e., motionless) and any portion of the *Robot* 
has crossed into the upwards vertical extension (i.e., at a right angle 
to the *Playing Field Floor*) of the *Backstage* taped boundary.

**Pro Tip:** The scoring referee has a short period of time between the 
end of the *Autonomous Period* and the start of the *Driver-Controlled 
Period* to record all of the *Autonomous Period Scoring* tasks. *Teams* 
can help the scoring referee accurately record an *Alliance's* scoring 
tasks by designing their *Autonomous* software so that their *Robot* is 
unambiguously *In* the *Backstage* at the end of the period.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The COTS USB battery pack mentioned in RE12.f.ii is
 a simple USB charging battery intended to allow mobile recharging of 
USB powered devices (phones, tablets, etc). There are many 
[examples](https://www.anker.com/products/a1287) available from many 
sources.

Thank you for asking about Battery Pack limitations. COTS USB Battery 
Packs are limited to a capacity of 27,000mAh or less. This is also the 
standard [TSA

COTS USB Battery Packs that adhere to the USB-PD or USB-QC specification
 may be used to provide a 12V source as described. Please ensure that 
the COTS USB External Battery is in no way connected to the robot's 
power system.

When using COTS USB External Battery Packs for legal LED and related 
uses, please observe a heightened level of vigilence in their safe use.

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reviewing the

After removing the *Pixel* from the *Backdrop*, the *Robot* in this 
scenario is no longer protected by rule GS05.c.v and is therefore 
*Possessing* three (3) *Pixels*, one (1) more than the maximum allowed 
number of *Pixels* per rule GS05.a. The *Robot/Alliance* should receive 
an immediate *Minor Penalty* for *Possessing* one  *Pixel* over the 
allowed limit of two (2) *Pixels*. An additional *Minor Penalty* for the
 excess *Possessed Pixel* should be assessed for each 5-second interval 
that the *Robot* continues to *Possesses* three (3) *Pixels*.

If the *Robot* *Scores* a *Pixel* on the *Backdrop* or in the

Q2: May the drive team coach move around the Alliance Station to be

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Yes, *Drive Team* members may use signaling 
aids that satisfy the restrictions listed below. 

!Q111 provides the *Human Player* with guidance for using signaling 
aids. *Drive Team* members in an *Alliance Station* may also use 
signaling aids with additional restrictions to address safety and 
interference issues that arise from six (6) people occupying a confined 
space. Guidance for the *Human Player* is less restrictive due to the 
isolated, single occupant *Human Player Station*.

*Drive Team* members may use signaling aids when abiding by the 
following restrictions:

1) The signaling aids are not a safety hazard. For example, placing a 
signaling aid on the floor is a tripping hazard.

2) Small hand-held signaling aids, including white boards and 
pre-printed signs, are allowed.

3) The signaling aid may not be intentionally dropped or placed on the 
floor.

4) If the signaling aid is accidentally dropped, it will not harm the 
venue floor. 

5) The signaling aid and *Drive Team* member do not distract an opposing
 *Alliance Drive Team* per rule G16.c.

6) The *Drive Team* member doesn't reach *Into* the *Playing Field* per 
rule GS12.h.

7) The signaling aid doesn't use electronics of any type per rule G11.

8) Dropped or placed signaling aid(s) into the *Playing Field* are 
subject to rule G22.

A2: Yes, provided that the *Drive Team* member remains *In* their 
*Alliance Station* per rules G16 and G16a, and does not distract nor 
interfere with the opposing *Alliance’s Human Player* or *Drive Team* 
per rule G16.c.</span>

No, *Drones* and *Pixels* may be placed or dropped into the *Wing* only 
during the *Driver-Controlled Period* per rule GS12.b. Each violation of
 this rule during the *Autonomous Period* or during the transition

	<h2>Q<span name="number">138</span> Follow Up to Q130</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">We wanted to confirm that the answer to 2) is a 
change from last year’s response, which said stalling was allowed. For 
clarification, we wanted to pose another case: during initialization 
(both during inspection &amp; pre-game) could we have the motors that 
power our lift move so that the lift is raised to a specific height? In 
this instance, the motor is not stalling: it is running to a position 
and then holding that position, the same way a servo holds its position 
while the robot is initialized.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Motors and servos "hold position" very differently.
 Motors with a load applied to their motor shaft can "hold position" 
through mechanical friction (via a gearbox/gear train) or through 
stalling. Servos with a load applied to their splines generally only 
"hold position" through stalling. If the motor can "hold position" even 
when power is no longer being applied to the motor, then that is legal. 
If power must be applied to the motor to hold position, it's not legal.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answer that you seek is found by reading the 
definition of *Spike Mark* in section 4.3 and the *Scoring* requirement 
stated in section 4.4.2 #2.a in Game Manual Part 2.

From section 4.3, the *Spike Mark* is the entire one (1) inch wide by

	<h2>Q<span name="number">144</span> Landing Zone In Venues</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">We host in a venue with a stage. The stage is 
slightly larger than the Playing Field Floor. The Landing Zone will 
cause us difficulties in hosting. Does the Landing Zone have to be a 
flat ground or could we erect nets that are placed with PVC pipe at the 
correct distances. For instance, at 24" there would be a net with the 
top level with the field. This would allow the Drone to hit it and fall 
down in the correct zone. Or is it required we build an extension to the
 stage for the landing zone?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The use of nets, either vertically or horizontally 
placed, would go against the intent of the challenge. 
1. Vertical nets would trap/capture drones inside a landing zone.
2. Horizontal nets allow the drones to be "caught" in the net.

An option would be to look over the venue layout and decide if the stage
 is the best option for the field, or if there may be a better space 
within the venue to accommodate the landing zones without the need to 
build an extension. If not, an extension off the stage may be built to 
accommodate the landing zones. We recommend placing field personnel (not
 referees) near the locations where stage and the extension zone meet so
 that no one walks on the extension. Stanchions or another deterrent 
from the audience approaching the landing zones should be a 
consideration to ensure audience members are not accidentally hit with 
launched drones.</span>

we think is intended. We seek to clarify Q141's answer. The

 the Control Hub provides a power/ground plane intended to be used to 
power sensors/pathways to provide a signal for Digital Channel 0 and/or 
Digital Channel 1 - not for a device/pathway providing signal to Digital

The specification for the yellow bar height is approximately 14".  
Applying the tolerances would suggest that a team should expect possible
 variations in the height of the yellow bars.  Teams should take into 
account the risks that come with not paying attention to these potential
 variations.

As is mentioned in the orange box, events strive to setup and maintain a
 much more accurate setup/placement of their fields and game elements,

	<h2>Q<span name="number">212</span> Team Numbers and definition of height</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question"><te05> b) The Team number may be no more than 0.5
 inches (1.27 cm) in height.

The formal definition of height is:  the distance from the bottom to the
 top of something, the distance upward from a given level to a fixed 
point, or something measured vertically.

Is a 3D-printed cylinder with numbers raised by ~0.25" on the top face 
be considered legal height for TE05 subrule (b) where a box of dims 
~0.75" x ~2.0" would enclose the numbers as viewed from above?</te05></span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Rule TE05 b refers to the height of the text from 
the bottom edge of the number to the top edge of the number as viewed 
perpendicular to the text. The rule does not restrict the distance that a
 number is extruded from a surface. When viewed from above, the numbers 
must fit into a box no larger than .5" height. The length of the box is 
dependent on the number of digits in your team number and is not 
restricted.</span>

 wondering specifically if this will affect our team props depending on 
the interpretation of "pattern".

We want to ask if this ruling will apply to the circular indentations on
 our props, which are cubes that have indentations placed on each side 
to make them look like 6-sided dice (DICE is our team name).</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answers to Q192 and Q197 have been updated as 
follows:
Based on the feedback we have received from Teams and volunteers we are 
clarifying and relaxing the restrictions on the types of images that are
 allowed on the Team Prop. The intent of rule TE03b is:
1.	prevent the use of any object on the field that could confuse or 
distract other Robots.
2.	prevent the use of canned solutions to simplify the task of object 
identification.

Therefore, any image that resembles a QR code, AprilTag, or coded vision
 target is not allowed.  All other images such as team logos, sponsor 
logos, raised areas, cut outs, etc. are allowed, providing no other rule
 is violated. 

A Team Prop made as you described is legal providing all other rules are
 met.</span>

 would not pass inspection, the wings would need to open when released

A *Backdrop* with a game changing shortcoming such as significant damage

	<h2>Q<span name="number">235</span> Prop color shade vs. tint</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Game Rule TE02 - ...Team Game Element may include
 multiple shades of the assigned color.

A shade of a color is a primary hue color with black added (color will 
be darker than the original).  A tint of a color is a primary color with
 white added (color will be lighter than the original).

Since Q15 answer was yes that light colors (light blue and pink) are 
allowed, does the rule mean tint (lighter colors) or shade (darker 
colors) of red or blue?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">240</span> More clarification to Q228 on swapping</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">I'm sorry, the question posed wasn't what was 
meant to be asked.  The question is, can FIRST consider the Robots (not 
the backdrops) swapping sides between elimination matches from Red to 
Blue to ensure that the field is not an advantage to one team or the 
other.  Much like Football.  RED in Match 1, is BLUE in Match 2. The 
backdrops can definitely affect gameplay this year, both position and 
deformity.  There is a time period between matches where the robots are 
removed from the field.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, the scoring system does not support 
*Teams/Robots* swapping *Alliances*.

Per !Q228, a *Backdrop* with a game changing shortcoming such as 
significant damage or incorrect assembly should be repaired or replaced 
before playing the next *Match*. A "small inwards bow" in a *Backdrop 
Scoring Area* is likely to be viewed by the Head Referee as normal 
variation caused by manufacturing and assembly tolerances that does not 
require repair or replacement for *Match* play to continue.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">241</span> Q188 and Q236 - which is correct?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q1: Since the forum is the final decision in game
 rules, Q188 would override the GS04 in this case.  Q2: Are Q188 or Q236
 correct?  Q188 says "Robots MAY move Scored Pixels from their 
Alliance's Backstage", overrides GS04.  Q236 states "NO, DESCORING a 
Pixel from an opposing Alliance's Backstagee or Backdrop is NOT 
ALLOWED"...by GS04.  Capitalization added to emphasis differences.  I 
would suggest updating either response so they are consistent.  Or is 
there something in Q188 that I am missing?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">!Q188 and !Q236 are both correct.

A1: !Q188 does not override rule GS04. !Q188 and rule GS04 address 
different gameplay scenarios. 

Rule GS04 prevents a *Robot* from descoring *Pixels* from an opposing 
*Alliance's Backdrop* or *Backstage*. In other words, a red *Alliance 
Robot* is not allowed to descore (i.e., remove)  a *Pixel* from the blue
 *Alliance's Backdrop* or *Backstage*. !Q236 is an example of a gameplay
 scenario that violates rule GS04.

!Q188 addresses the scenario where a *Robot* descores (i.e., removes) a 
*Pixel* from its own *Alliance's Backstage* and then places that *Pixel 
On* their own *Alliance's Backdrop*. For example, a red *Alliance Robot*
 descores a *Pixel* from the red *Alliance Backstage* and places that 
*Pixel On* the red *Alliance Backdrop*. This scenario is allowed.

In summary, a *Robot* may descore *Pixels* from its own *Alliance's 
Backdrop* or *Backstage* because there is no rule against this activity.
  A *Robot* may not descore *Pixels* from its opposing *Alliance's 
Backdrop* or *Backstage* per rule GS04.

A2: !Q188 and !Q236 are both correct. See A1 above for the rationale.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>

 or c) two (2) *Pixels In* the *Wing*, per rule GS12.c

GS09.d.

The *Human Player* may continue to place *Pixels In* the *Wing* per rule
 GS12 until the six (6) *Pixel* limit is reached, per rule GS09.d.

For example:

i) There are four (4) *Pixels In* the *Wing*. The *Human Player* has the
 option of placing either one (1) or two (2) additional *Pixels* into 
the *Wing*.

ii) There are five (5) *Pixels In* the *Wing*. The *Human Player* may

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">If a team provides the Event Host, FTA or 
Regional Director at an FTC event with anti-static spray, is there 
precedent for the FTA (or other field staff) to spray the field before 
matches? Our team has severe issues with static, while using the 
grounding strap, and our FTA at our competition today (12/16/23 NJ) told
 us to ask this specific question because our fields have very bad 
static at every competition in the winter. See 'Managing Electrostatic 
Discharge Effects' on FTC Docs for precedent.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Spraying the playing field tiles is an Event Host 
decision, regardless of who provides the anti-static spray. The Event 
Host may use *FIRST* recommended antistatic spray provided by any 
supplier they choose.

**Bonus Information:**

1) Is your robot ESD protected? We suggest reviewing the guidance in 
["Managing Electrostatic Discharge 
Effects"](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/
hardware_and_software_configuration/configuring/managing_esd/managing-
esd.html?highlight=%22Managing%20Electrostatic%20Discharge%20Effects) on
 FTC Docs. 

2) Have you thoroughly inspected your wiring to look for damaged 
insulation? Pay special attention to sensor and servo wires.

3) Are any power cable connections loose? For example, [are the Control 
or Expansion Hub X30 Ports 
compressed?](https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/troubleshooting-

1) Regardless of a *Robot's* size, *Drive Teams* have an obligation not 
to: damage another *Robot* (G26), *Pin*, *Trap*, or *Block* another 
*Robot* (G28), or exercise egregious behavior (G30).

2) *Robots* that extend significant distances do not gain gameplay 
protections.

A1: It depends on how the gameplay action is viewed by the referee crew.
 A light bump or a glancing blow are likely to be viewed as normal 
gameplay. Repeated *Robot* impacts, contact with no clear gameplay 
purpose, or high energy contact are examples of gameplay that are likely
 to be viewed as violations of rules G26 or G30.

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">During the end game a red alliance robot is 
attempting a drone launch and suspending at the same time a blue 
alliance robot bumps them. 
Q1: Do they get the 30 points for the drone parking task?
Q2: Do they get points for suspending too?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: This question describes the same gameplay 
scenario as !Q151. Yes, if the referee believes that the *Robot* contact
 affected the *Drone*, rule GS11.g.iii is violated and the *Drone* will 
receive *Landing Zone 1* points (30 points). For example, contact 
directly before the *Drone* is *Launched* should be considered as 
affecting the flight of the *Drone*.

From !Q151: "The gameplay described in the question is not allowed per 
rule GS11.g.iii. *Drive Teams* may not directly or indirectly affect the
 flight of a *Drone*. The *Robot* in this scenario is under control of 
the *Drive Team* during all valid *Drone* launching times, *Robot* 
interactions that affect *Drone* flight are controlled by the *Drive 
Teams* yielding indirect *Interference*."

A2: Yes, if the *Robot* satisfies the requirements for being 
*Suspended*. Depending on the timing of the contact, the blue *Alliance 
Robot* may receive rule GS06.d and/or GS06.e consequences.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">290</span> How Are "Best Matches" Defined For League Ranking</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In Game Manual Part 1 Section 5.1, what is the 
definition of "top ten matches"? For example, let's say that a team has 
played 15 matches in their league. They have won 10 of them. They have 
an RP of 2.0. Let's say they had 20 pts in auto for each of those 
matches won, however, they scored 40 pts in auto in one match they lost 
and 0 pts for the rest of the matches. Would TBP1 be 20 pts (consisting 
of matches they won) or 22 pts (from best autonomous score matches, 
regardless of win/loss)?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The 10 best <i>Matches</i> are chosen such that they maximize the <i>Team's</i> <i>Ranking</i>. That is, each <i>Match</i> has:

1. <i>Ranking Points</i> 
2. <i>TieBreaker Points</i> (TBP1, autonomous score)
3. <i>TieBreaker Points</i> (TBP2, end game score) 
4. <i>Match</i> Score (including penalties)

The "best" 10 *Matches* are selected to maximize the *Team's* rank using
 the criteria outlined in game manual part 1, as shown above.

For your example, the outcome is that any <i>Match</i> with a win will be ranked higher than a tie/loss, even if the TBP1 is better in a <i>Match</i>
 that results in a loss (0 RP). It is always more beneficial to have the
 higher RP than the higher TBP1.

description of averages, and section 5.2 for League Meet and Tournament 
Rankings.</span>

	<span name="question">Could there be a change in next year's manual to 
fix the confusion between "end of period" defined as "start of the 
sound" in the definitions &amp; G20.b saying that it doesn't count if 
not started before "end of period"?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Addressing the issues in order:

1. Suggestions for future seasons should be emailed to 
[firsttechchallenge@firstinspires.org]
(mailto:firsttechchallenge@firstinspires.org) per Appendix A in Game 
Manual Part 2.

2. There is no conflict in the Game Manual Part 2 between the definition
 of *End of Period* and rule G20b. The definition of *End of Period* 
describes when a period ends. Rule G20.b addresses *Robot* actions that 
occur at the defined *End of Period* event. Also, the statement in the 
*Team's* post that rule G20.b states that "it doesn't count if not 
started before "end of period" is the exact opposite of the rule's 
description in the game manual. The referenced defined term and rule in 
Game Manual Part 2 are shown below for reference.

The definition of *End of Period* is: "The moment when the *Match* timer
 reaches 2:00 for the *Autonomous Period* or 0:00 for the 
*Driver-Control Period* and which coincides with the start of the sound 
that designates the *End of the Period*."

Rule G20.b states: "*Scoring* achievements that were started (unless 
disallowed by Game-Specific rules) before the *End of the Period* are 
eligible to be counted as *Scored*."

Rule G20.b states that *Scoring* achievements that were started before 
the *End of the Period* **are eligible** to be counted as *Scored*.</span>

Rephrasing the scenario to: A *Robot* intentionally knocks over  *Pixel*
 stacks in a manner that is allowed by rule GS05.c.i so it will be 
harder for certain types of *Robots*, such as those picking up two

	<span name="question">1. In reference to the part W44609 TETRIX® MAX 
Gripper Arm Kit from legal and illegal parts, the robot inspectors 
referred to rule RM02 Commercial Off-The-Shelf Parts. Our claw uses one

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">In general, a 100% team manufactured 
component/assembly is allowed, even if it is an exact copy of an illegal
 COTS component. If any portion of the component/assembly is part of an 
illegal COTS kit (i.e., not manufactured by the team), the entire 
component/assembly is not allowed. Of course, using general purpose 
fasteners (e.g., screws, nuts, bolts, etc.) from an illegal kit is 
allowed.</span>

allowed to bring one robot to a competition. However, our team would 
like to bring an additional (completely different) robot solely for the 
purpose of demonstrating during judging with zero intention of competing
 with it. Q1: Are we allowed to do this? Under what conditions of the

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A team cannot bring an entire second robot to a 
competition. If the team would like to show unique parts or mechanisms 
of the robot, and those mechanisms are not being used at the current 
competition, those may be brought to be used as a visual aide. 
Otherwise, teams can use pictures, video, or animations to show past 
iterations of their robot without needing to bringing a secondary robot.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">312</span> Clarification PWM Signal wire may be relieved from Q85, RE14</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The PWM wire (of the 3 wires) is a pulse width 
(of ~800-2200 microsecond) carrying wire and not current carrying. Teams
 can optimize and reduce the wire size to better innovate. Manufacturers
 utilize the same gauge for PWM as Power for convenience and not 
necessity, lower gauges will not create negative impact or safety 
concern and increase innovation. Team design and reliability is the 
proof.
Can FIRST exempt PWM signal wires and allow =&gt;32awg.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The short answer is No.

For reasons of safety, all wires in the PWM wiring bundle must be no 
less than 22AWG as referenced in !Q85.

A simple inversion of the connector where it plugs into the 
control/expansion hubs would result in the ground and signal lines being
 swapped and the undersized signal line now needing to carry the full 
current of the servo.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The answers that you seek are found by reading rule
 GS05 in Game Manual Part 2. There are also several posts to this 
Q&amp;A forum that address related scenarios that are found by searching
 for the word "stack."

Please note that watching gameplay video provides a limited view of the 
*Robot's* actions and their outcomes. A referee watching gameplay may 
notice a rule violation that is not visible in a video.

A1: No, per rule GS05.c.i.

A2: If the *Robots* in the videos *Possess* two or fewer *Pixels*, their
 actions applied to a single *Pixel Stack* are allowed per rule 
GS05.c.i. There are two other considerations if the *Robot* causes 
movement of *Pixels* in an adjacent *Pixel Stack*:

Example 1: If as part of the *Robot's* actions, *Pixels* in an adjacent 
*Pixel Stack* remain stacked and are moved completely off of their white
 tape line, rule GS05.a is violated per rule GS05.c.ii. 

Example 2: If as part of the *Robot's* actions, *Pixels* in an adjacent 
*Pixel Stack* are knocked off and are no longer stacked, there is no 
*Penalty* per rule GS05.c.i.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">We apologize that this mix-up impacted your team,

strive to ensure that teams have the best experience possible.

Where field inspections take place is up to the tournament director. 
There are multiple factors that play into where inspections take place 
(either practice or competition fields) including timing of event setup,
 logistics of the location of pits to the designated inspection 
location, etc. 

If a team notices an error in field setup, it is perfectly acceptable, 
and encouraged, for the team to get the Head Referee or Field Technical 
Advisor involved.

If the error on the field is not discovered until after match play has 
begun, the Head Referee and/or FTA should be notified to fix the field. 
It is up to the discretion of the Head Referee to determine if matches 
should be replayed.</span>

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: The *Robot* in this scenario has violated rules
 GS06.a and GS06.b. Rule GS06.d is not violated because the scenario 
does not involve an opposing *Alliance Robot*.

A2: The referee watching gameplay will make the rule GS06.d 
determination if the *Suspended Robot* on the incorrect *Rigging* 
impedes or obstructs an opposing *Alliance Robot* from *Suspending* 
during the *End Game*. The opposing *Alliance Robot* is not required to 
engage with the *Rigging* nor touch the *Suspended Robot* to trigger a 
rule GS06.d violation.

A3: A2 applies, plus there is no required minimum distance between 
*Robots* that automatically triggers a rule GS06.d violation. The 
opposing *Alliance Robot's* actions should be obvious and unambiguous to
 signal that their intent to *Suspend* is affected by the *Robot* that

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">During the driver-controlled period, if a robot 
stops moving in front of (not in) the opposing alliances wing creating a
 situation that the only way the opposing alliance can get in the wing 
is to push the non moving robot into the wing, would this be a violation
 of GS09.b. Q2: Would the pushing robot in this case violate G03? Q3: If
 the non moving robot is disconnected and non functioning does this 
change the answer?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: If we understand the scenario correctly, a red 
*Alliance Robot*  does not move, it has not been declared *Disabled* by a
 referee, and it is *Blocking* a blue *Alliance Robot* from accessing 
the blue *Alliance Wing*. Rule GS09.b consequences apply to the red 
*Alliance Robot* while it is *Outside* the *Wing*. See A2 below for how 
to apply gameplay rules after the blue *Alliance Robot* pushes the red 
*Alliance Robot In* the *Wing*.

A2: Rule G03 protections for the red *Alliance Robot* do not apply when 
the blue *Alliance Robot* pushes the red *Alliance Robot* into the 
*Wing* because rule GS09.b was already violated before the *Robot* was 
pushed into the *Wing*; rule GS09.b is continuously violated in this 
scenario. Rule GS09.b consequences should be applied to the red 
*Alliance Robot* for the entire time.

A3: If we understand the new scenario correctly, the only change is that
 the red *Alliance Robot* is declared *Disabled* by a referee for the 
entire scenario. 

While *Outside* the *Wing*, rule G07 protects the *Disabled* red 
*Alliance Robot* from receiving *Penalties*.

The *Disabled* red *Alliance Robot* that was pushed by the blue

 use a 3-wire 18 AWG multi-conductor coiled cable to create a custom

	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The use of 18AWG wire to make servo extensions fits
 within the guidance for servo wire sizes and connections (i.e. 22AWG or
 larger, remember that smaller numbers equate to larger wire diameters).

While it's legal to allow multiple servos to share servo power from the 
same servo port (e.g. using a servo "Y" cable or equivalent) it is not 
allowed to combine power across multiple servo ports - that could create
 potential overcurrent conditions and safety issues. If you do use a "Y"
 cable (or equivalent), be careful not to exceed the current rating of 
22AWG wire; each servo will still attempt to pull its maximum rated 
current at stall, regardless of the size wire being used, and that 
current stacks for both servos.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">In general it's not possible for us to blanket rule
 on the legality of a generic cable (with no connectors) because it's 
impossible for us to predict how you'll eventually be using that cable. 
This is especially true for multi-conductor cable bundles where there 
are even more considerations to make. 

When considering the legality of a multi-conductor cable used for 
powering/controlling servos, keep in mind these considerations:

- If each conductor of the 22AWG cable bundle is 1:1 replacing a single 
conductor in an existing 22AWG servo cable bundle (6 conductors = 2 
servo 3-wire bundles) then you will likely not run afoul of current 
carrying limits; be careful to read the cable specs to ensure the cable 
can handle the current load (2+ Amps for most servos).
- RE14.f and RE14.i will need to be carefully considered, especially if 
you'll be crimping new 3-pin 0.1" servo connectors to the 
multi-conductor bundle ([colored heat shrink](https://a.co/d/iYS8y4b) 
does wonders).
- Be sure to have documentation about the wire bundle conductors at
