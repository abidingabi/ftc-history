	<h2>Q<span name="number">5</span> Pinning: Tilting vs Tipping</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Rule G423 states the maximum duration of PINS is 5
 seconds, implying that pinning is allowed. The glossary defines 
PIN/PINNING to include (c) Controlling an opponent's movements by 
raising or tilting the opponent's ROBOT off the TILES. However, rule 
G422 prohibits tipping. Could you clarify the definitions of tilting vs.
 tipping--is the latter supposed to refer to the robot completely going 
over on its side?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Rule !G423 is not intended to allow PINNING, rather
 it is a warning that if a ROBOT is PINNING an opposing ALLIANCE ROBOT, 
they must correct the situation within 5 seconds before receiving a 
FOUL. 

Tilting a ROBOT off its CHASSIS in a way such that the ROBOT cannot move
 in any direction is considered PINNING. The affected ROBOT is able to 
drive again once the offending ROBOT backs away. 

Tipping a ROBOT means to cause the ROBOT to fall over, as described in 
the orange box in rule !G422.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">14</span> What time is exactly ASCENT scored?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Q1: What time is ASCENT scored in practice? 

Q2: Is it exactly at the end of the buzzer sound, which is 3 seconds 
after the game timer ends? 

Q3: If the robot ASCENDS at the 3 second mark, but drops at 4 seconds, 
does it still get the ASCENT score? 

Q4: Or as long as the robot is ASCENDED at any time in that 3 seconds 
does it get the score? Last year hanging was scored as long as the robot
 hanged in any of those 3 seconds.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Per section 10.5, the assessment of ASCENT 
points is made at two possible points in time: 1) 3 seconds after the 
ARENA timer reaches the end of the MATCH, or 2) when all ROBOTS have 
come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH whichever happens 
first.

A2: The buzzer sound is provided as a courtesy alert that 3 seconds have
 elapsed after the end of the MATCH. Since not all events provide the 
section 9.10 Event Management System audio queues, Scoring is determined
 based on the 3 second elapsed time after the ARENA timer reaches the 
end of the MATCH per section 10.5. If all ROBOTS have not yet come to 
rest, the ASCENT status is determined 3 seconds after the ARENA timer 
reaches the end of the MATCH.

A3: Yes, if ROBOTS are not at rest, the ASCENT is determined at 3 
seconds after the ARENA timer reaches the end of the MATCH. The ROBOT'S 
ASCENT status is not relevant to scoring  at 4 seconds after the MATCH 
ends.

A4: The answer depends on if all ROBOTS are stationary or not. Per 
section 10.5, ROBOT ASCENT status is determined either at 3 seconds 
after the ARENA timer reaches the end of the MATCH, or when all ROBOTS 
have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH whichever 
happens first. For example, if all ROBOTS come to rest 2 seconds after 
the conclusion of the MATCH, that is the time ROBOT ASCENT status is 
determined for scoring.</span>

Q2: When ROBOTS start their ASCENDING, is it legal to swing into the

10.5.3. B says :"ROBOTS must start ASCENDING from outside the

wheel is not inside the SUBMERSIBLE.

A2: Yes, if it is clear to the REFEREE that the ROBOT has started 
pulling itself upwards via the LOW RUNG as it swings into the

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">!R403 was written liberally to allow some 
creativity for teams in representing their team numbers. There are no 
rules regarding font stroke width or the specific font to be used, but 
teams MUST ensure that the team number is easily readable by REFEREES

with different behaviors will be required to be inspected separately. 
The team must demonstrate that software will keep the extensions within

 inside the bounding box and extend it in another direction without 
turning the robot in a different direction. If an arm extends in the "x 
direction," can that arm retract and then extend in the "y direction"?

(Q2) Does the 20" x 42" bounding box reset or does this box make the use
 of any turning platform devices (e.g. turrets) non-compliant on a 
robot.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">(A2) The horizontal size boundary never "resets" - 
as described in !Q13, !R104 part D requires that the maximum extent of 
all MECHANISMS cannot exceed the horizontal size boundary. The orange 
box on !R104 also clarifies that, "All possible movement of extensions 
outside the STARTING CONFIGURATION must be constrained within the 
horizontal size boundary." This is exemplified in the examples presented
 in Figure 12-2. 

(A1) A rotating arm is no different than any other MECHANISM that 
extends. If the MECHANISM is allowed to extend in both the X and -X 
direction, assuming the horizontal size boundary defined by the ROBOT 
orientation is 42" across the X axis, the sum of the allowed (through

	<h2>Q<span name="number">93</span> Do the horizontal extension limits pitch and roll with the robot?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">R104 states that the horizontal extension limits 
are measured co-planar to the floor, and they translate &amp; rotate 
with the robot, but do they also pitch and roll with the robot?
For example, if we have a robot that is 18x18x18 and has a front 
extension that moves out 24" then it is within the bounds when flat on 
the tiles, but if the robot tips backwards (or sideways) e.g. when 
ascending then the back (side) of the robot has effectively extended out
 of bounds with respect to the coplanar tiles.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Good question! The answer is no, because the 
horizontal boundary defined in !R104 is always co-planar to the floor 
regardless of how the ROBOT moves (including pitches and rolls). Without
 the co-planar restriction, a ROBOT would otherwise be able to tip over 
and use its normally unlimited vertical extension to reach horizontally.
 You have correctly interpreted the rule, and have identified a

	<h2>Q<span name="number">106</span> Can one replace the mechanical casing of COTS device?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Our team uses an USB camera (from Logitech) for 
CV, motion guidance and so on.
Because the original camera is not intended to be mounted on a 
mechanical apparatus and because it is too wide the team decided to 
design a new mechanical plastic shell for the electronics of the camera 
totally replacing the original plastic casing (the new casing was 3D 
printed and the electronics and optics were not altered).
Regarding Rule R301 it seems that it should be fine  we want to double 
check it here.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There are several key considerations that must be 
taken into account when determining if it's okay to replace the outer 
case of any given COTS device:

1. Is this COTS device protected by a rule? For example, !R712 disallows
 modifying core control system devices including batteries, and !R504 
disallows modifying actuators (such as servos), and so on. In these 
cases, you are specifically not allowed to modify or replace its casing.

2. Is this COTS device being inspected by name/SKU? For example, the 
Limelight 3A casing cannot be replaced because inspectors must be able 
to recognize the device - the Competition Manual calls it out by name in
 !R703.  You also cannot modify the assembly for any legal Main Power 
Switch allowed by !R609 (cannot modify the rocker switch or housing, but
 can certainly change out the mounting bracket as it's not an integrated
 part of the product).

3. Is this COTS device being inspected by specifications? For example, 
USB battery packs allowed by !R602 requires verification that the 
battery pack meets specific requirements. Generally these requirements 
can be met through text written on the device itself (by the 
manufacturer), or by identifying the device and being presented by 
documentation provided by the manufacturer regarding that device - 
regardless, it requires that the device be identifiable. Modifying its 
casing would not be advisable.

4. Is this COTS device being inspected by class? In your case, !R715 
points to the general class of "UVC compatible USB webcams." As long as

but per Table 10-2 robots must be fully supported by the RUNG at the end

A) Software is implemented that only X or Y one could be used during a

R104 states extensions may be software or hardware limited. Q41 
challenges this.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Good question. Upon closer review, it appears we 
misunderstood the question being asked in !Q41. We corrected the answer 
to !Q41 on 10/17/2024. 

Each ROBOT configuration (which includes any software limiting each 
MECHANISM) must be inspected per !R104 individually as the software 
limits being employed may change. It is possible to have multiple 
configurations in a single OpMode, and each must be inspected 
individually. 

A)  This is legal. An expansion of zero inches for a given extension in a
 ROBOT configuration is a valid software limit. During inspection, each 
software configuration with different behaviors will be required to be 
inspected separately. Please work with your inspector to be expedient if
 presenting multiple configurations.

B) If X or Y are interchangeable MECHANISMS, and you choose to only 
include one on your ROBOT for a given ROBOT configuration, this would be
 legal and regulated per !I303 part A. During inspection, each physical 
configuration of the ROBOT and software behaviors (e.g., software 
limits) would be required to be inspected separately. Please work with 
your inspector to be expedient if presenting multiple configurations.

C) This would be legal. Per !I304 the addition, relocation, or removal 
of fasteners (such as cable ties) does not require a reinspection.

	<h2>Q<span name="number">116</span> Are servo travel tuners allowed?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">In reviewing R502 and R506, we are unsure of the 
legality of a servo travel tuner. 
(https://www.gobilda.com/servo-travel-tuner/)  R502 says a position 
output interface is allowed, but R506 states that alternative electrical
 actuation is not allowed.  Please provide some guidance on the 
terminology.  Thank you!</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, the goBILDA servo travel tuner is not legal for
 use in FIRST Tech Challenge. Its purpose is to intercept the control 
signal sent by a Power Regulation Device (in this case a REV Control 
Hub, REV Expansion Hub, or REV Servo Hub) and either pass through or 
generate a new signal to send to the actuator (servo). CUSTOM CIRCUITS 
(like the Servo Travel Tuner) are not allowed to control actuators per 
!R505.

!R502's "additional servo position output interfaces" allows for more 
than just the three-wire control and power interface to a servo, it 
allows for the servo to provide feedback. Some servos provide servo arm 
position through an analog interface, but there's no reason to limit 
servo feedback through specific interfaces. 

!R506's "alternative electrical actuation" header is a colloquial 
summary of the rule; in !R506, additional actuators such as solenoids, 
electromagnets, and other methods of electrical actuation not listed 
(HASEL actuators are an example) are not allowed.</span>

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">G406 allows DRIVE TEAMS to put down the ROBOT 
gamepads at the end of the MATCH while the ROBOT OpMode is still 
running, allowing the ROBOT code to keep powering motors to keep the 
ROBOT on the RUNG. G502 forces teams to press STOP on the DRIVER STATION
 app before entering the field. Q1: Are we allowed to run a different 
OpMode or operate our ROBOT to release it from the RUNG before we hit 
STOP? Q2: Can we also run motors to release SCORING ELEMENTS the ROBOT 
may still be holding on to?</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No for both questions. 

!G406 prohibits active control of a ROBOT after the end of the TELEOP 
period. 

Additionally, !G413 prohibits ROBOT actions that case undue hazards to 
humans. Unexpected ROBOT movement during MATCH reset presents hazard to 
humans entering the field to retrieve ROBOTS that are supposed to be 
motionless.

The only actions that are allowed post MATCH are to ensure that the STOP
 button has been pressed as required by !G502 and retrieve the ROBOT 
without significant delay as noted in !G501</span>

We think that it is legal because:

- It does not use a wireless signal. (R709)
- Its USB battery pack will remain electrically isolated from the ROBOT power systems. (R602)
- We will not have any lights flash at 2Hz. (R203)

footprint, not an instantaneous snapshot. If one expansion MECHANISM 
reaches a large distance in one direction, the expansion envelope for 
the ROBOT grows to that large amount. This would only leave a very small
 amount in the opposite direction, even if the original MECHANISM has

	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">We have a rotating arm that will only be used in 
the forward direction and will be well within the 42" length. However, 
using the teleop controls it is possible to override our limits and make
 it go backward which would exceed the 42" rule. We will not do this in 
the match, but the inspection process says that we must show ALL op 
modes. We have an articulated arm so we cannot physically constrain all 
backward motion. So are we ok as long as we never exceed the 42" rule 
during operation?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There is no requirement to show all OpModes during 
inspection. 

Per !R104 ROBOTS during inspection are required to demonstrate hardware 
or software limits that constrain the ROBOT operation. This can be 
software that limits arm articulation based on an encoder value, 
hardware limits that prevent the arm from exceeding a specific range of 
motion, or similar.

If the override is necessary to use during a MATCH, teams should be sure
 to not violate rule !G418.</span>

timer displays 0:00? 2) Per Q126, "Any intentional ROBOT movement [after
 the match] would be considered [...] a violation of G406". However, per
 Q78, a PID on an ASCENT mechanism would be allowed. Would a PID that 
automatically moves the robot from no ASCENT to, say, a LEVEL 2 or 3 
ASCENT, be penalized under G406?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Please remember that the orange box is a 
clarification of the rule, not the rule itself. 

A1: The end of each MATCH period occurs when the timer reaches ZERO 
seconds remaining in the match period. 

A2: !Q78 specified that OpModes do not have to be stopped at the end of 
the MATCH, confirming the question's premise asking if an active OpMode 
may be used to keep the ROBOT from falling off a RUNG. !Q126 (answer 
updated 11/21/2024) confirmed that the ROBOT cannot continue to 
intentionally move in an attempt to receive additional points for a 
scoring achievement after the end of the MATCH (as opposed to 
unintentionally move, as in fall). A ROBOT that continues active motion 
(as opposed to swaying due to "physics") after the end of the MATCH will
 be penalized under !G406.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">186</span> Robot Sign Color Rule Clarification - Is Navy Blue or Dark Red Signs Allowed?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Rule R402 states that we must use a "solid red or
 blue opaque background to indicate ... ALLIANCE color". Per 
Merriam-Webster dictionary, opaque is defined as "blocking the passage 
of ... light".
According to this it would mean that any fully filled (non transparent) 
background for the red or blue alliance is legal. There are no rules 
referencing how dark or light the shades of blue or red can be on the 
sign.
For example, would Navy Blue or Dark Red Alliance color signs with white
 text be legal?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">There is no defined RGB color for "red" or "blue" 
for ROBOT SIGNS, this is intentional to allow teams to best utilize 
available materials to create legal ROBOT SIGNS. The final decision of 
legality lies with the Lead ROBOT Inspector (LRI) at each event. If 
colors are dark enough that they're close to black and/or not easily 
distinguished as "red" or "blue", they're not likely to satisfy the 
requirements of !R402.</span>

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No.  The orange box for G208 specifically talks 
about what constitutes "Entering" a ROBOT into an event.

It specifically mentions use of a ROBOT as an aid to judging as an 
example of entering a ROBOT into an event.

The allowance for ROBOTS from other programs is meant to provide more 
visibility into the breadth of the FIRST programs.

A secondary non-functional, non-playable robot like assembly used for 
judging only must not comply with the glossary term of ROBOT as defined 
in section 16 of the competition manual. 

Teams may also use pictures, video, or animations to show past 
iterations of their ROBOT without needing to bring a robot like assembly
 for judging purposes.</span>

	<span name="answer">A1: !R712 part E does not appear to apply to the

	<h2>Q<span name="number">217</span> Using Hooks and a winch cable for ascent, not launched</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">Our current design for ascent uses hooks mounted 
magnetically to rigid servo arms on the robot.  When the servo arm 
contacts one of the rungs, the robot will retract a tethered cable 
breaking the hook from the magnet and winching up the robot as the cable
 is wound in.  Is this process legal based on Rule G209 as the hook is 
not operated independently even though it is tethered to the robot.</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">This question was edited on 12/4/2024

Based on the description, this design would be legal, since the hooks 
are mounted to the ROBOT, do not move or operate independently from the 
ROBOT, and do not detach from the ROBOT. 

Keep in mind to not violate other rules related to entanglement such as 
!R203 L, !G416 D, and !G422.

A future team update will be released to remove the second sentence from
 rule !G209 for clarity. The intent of the rule is that ROBOTS do not 
detach parts or leave parts on the FIELD.</span>

	<span name="question">A scoring element is stuck within a ROBOT.  The 
robot navigates to the OBSERVATION ZONE.  The HUMAN PLAYER retrieves the
 stuck scoring element from the ROBOT.  Both HUMAN PLAYER and ROBOT are 
in the OBSERVATION ZONE for less than three seconds.  It is unclear if 
HUMAN PLAYER makes contact with the ROBOT. Q1: What are the FOULS in 
this scenario? Q2: Are there any additional consequences for an 
intentional FOUL? Q3: What are the consequences for repeated use of the 
OBSERVATION ZONE as a pitstop?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">A1: Once the HUMAN PLAYER retrieves the stuck item,
 they are in violation of !G431 d. or !G432 (MINOR FOUL, YELLOW CARD if 
the HUMAN PLAYER contacts the ROBOT). 

A2 and A3: There may be additional consequences for an intentional FOUL 
(for example, rule !G211) that would be assessed by the HEAD REFEREE.</span>

 the blue alliance began intaking under the red chamber as we were 
actively cycling into the chamber. They attempted to intake for 20

	<span name="question">Can the drive team use an alignment tool, for 
example, a flat piece of cardboard or plastic, to align samples on the 
spike marks prior to the start of a match? Once the samples are aligned,
 the tool would be removed from the field, prior to the start of the 
match. Section 10.3.1 allows teams to adjust them, and since the samples
 are 1.5" inches wide and the spike marks are 1" wide, there is still 
0.5" of alignment error that can happen with the sample still completely
 covering the spike marks.</span>

	<span name="answer">!R503 is explicit that a ROBOT may not have more 
than 8 motors and 12 servos, and makes no exemptions for whether those 
actuators are powered or unpowered. There are no rules that prohibit 
using motors as ballast (for example !R605 prohibits using batteries as 
ballast and !R205 prohibits ballast not secured sufficiently) as long as
 you are still within the legal limits of !R503. Other materials that 
adhere to COTS requirements, [for example](https://a.co/d/9rP3Cjv), can 
also be used for ballast.</span>

1. Does "block all access" mean "Block ANY 1 of those areas" when

2. Does "Block all access" mean opponent robot can't find any path to go

	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Very few manufacturers provide their full 
specification sheets with the packaged product (usually missing the 
stall current), often times you only receive the marketing or 
promotional materials. Many manufacturers can provide their device's 
full specification sheets, but you have to contact them directly for the
 information. Regardless, the documentation needed to satisfy R502 is 
something from the manufacturer themselves that provide the following 
information:

1. Operating speed (no-load) at 6V (or a higher voltage)
2. Stall Torque (at locked) at 6V (or a higher voltage)
3. Stall Current (at locked) at 6V (or a higher voltage)

These are the pieces of information necessary to calculate the servo 
mechanical power and to verify the maximum stall current of the device.

These are examples of servo specification sheets with all the required

the initialization to control the robot before the autonomous period 
(e.g. inputting the position where the robot goes to collect samples 
from the Submersible, even though the sample randomization is an

	<h2>Q<span name="number">363</span> Legality of the original Matrix 14-011 12V DC motor?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">The name: Modern Robotics/Matrix 12V DC motor. 
This name is used for two different motor models: a) Modern 
Robotics/Matrix 12V DC motor - in fact the original Matrix 14-011 12V DC
 motor -  and b) Modern Robotics/Matrix 12V DC motor 5000-0002-001. The 
first model is mentioned in the legal-illegal parts list of the Center 
Stage season and the second model in the competion manual of the current
 Into The Deep season. Is the original Matrix 14-011 12V DC motor still 
legal? We really like to use it!</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">No, that motor is no longer listed in the legal 
motors. Motors which have not been purchasable through the original 
manufacturer or from resellers for several seasons are likely to be 
removed from the legal motor list since it's no longer obtainable by all
 teams.</span>

	<h2>Q<span name="number">368</span> Is it allowed to use two (or more) cameras on the Robots?</h2>
	<b>Q:</b>
	<span name="question">As for R715  and R714 it is not clear if only one
 camera is allowed or one can use more if they are connected to the 
Hub's USBs ports. 
In Q152 it is written that one can use cameras on the robot</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">The [Competition 
Manual](https://ftc-resources.firstinspires.org/file/ftc/game/manual) 
does not provide any limitations on the number of legal webcams or 
vision devices used on a ROBOT - teams using more than one webcam must 
consider power requirements of the cameras, and are strongly encouraged 
to use powered hubs (like the [REV 
UltraUSB](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1592/)). In some cases, 
like the LimeLight Vision LimeLight 3A, there are technical limitations 
with the hardware that only allow one to be used on the ROBOT at a time.
 It is also not recommended to use the USB 2.0 port on the Control Hub 
for cameras since the USB 2.0 port shares the same USB hub as the 
ROBOT's Wi-Fi chip and any ESD shock to devices connected to USB 2.0 
will likely also cause Wi-Fi disconnects.</span>

1)https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-4099.html - Short Shifter Shaft
2)https://www.vexrobotics.com/shifter-gears.html-  34T shifter gear SKU#: 217-3212

Each of the COTS components listed above is single DOF.
So, is the assembly made out of these components is legal?</span>
	<br><br>
	<b>A:</b>
	<span name="answer">Be aware that pneumatics are not allowed on a ROBOT
 per !R207 and !R801, but the components you have identified are legal 
themselves. Make sure you find a way to actuate the part that does not 
involve pneumatics. So yes, an assembly made of these components would 
be legal.</span>
